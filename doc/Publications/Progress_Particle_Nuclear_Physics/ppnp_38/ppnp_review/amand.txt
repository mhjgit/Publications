***** answers to referees

First of all we would like to use this opportunity to thank both referee for their kind comments about
our contributions. We've tried as far as possible to include the suggested improvements and do hope that
the manuscript in its present is deemed publishable.
Below we describe briefly our changes according to your comments, including where the changes have been made
in the main text.

We've extended section 6 on the coupled cluster method including more details 
and results. Regarding the Parquet calculations we are not yet in a stage where we 
have derived effective interactions for open shell systems. 
This applies to the coupled cluster calculations as well and will be addressed by us in future works. 
We have added a discussion of this in our perspectives as it belongs to our plans for future projects.
The time window for this is however unfortunately beyond the one for the present review article. 
We are now in a position where we have computed excited and ground state properties of He4 and O16
with the coupled cluster method only. Our Parquet analysis is still incomplete for these nuclei.
We have therefore limited the discussion of the Parquet method to the presentation 
of formalism in an angular momentum basis (never done before) and presentation of the algorithm. 
We expect to produce reliable results for the above closed shell nuclei by the end of the year.

Our changes:
--> We've included these references and discuss their relevance at 
the beginning of section 3.


>
> Now some small things very easy to fix :
>
> 1) P^2 = p ==> P^2 =P   (after eq. (2))
--> Done
>
> 2) Dyson eq. (31) should be with plus or minus sign ?
>
--> Corrected
> 3) It can be useful for the reader to have a comment on why the factor
> 1/2 in eq. (29)
> is not need in eq. (34)
--> We've added a discussion right after eq 30 and eq. 34.
>
> 4) at the end of Pag. 14
>  need be explained ===> need to be explained
--> Done
> 5) pag 22 before eq (66)
>
> from n folds the following ===> from n folds by the following ...
--> done
> 6) pag 24 last paragraph
>
>  fulfull ===> fulfil
--> done
> 7) In sect. (3.4) there is a mixing between omega and Omega ....
--> corrected
> 8) Pag 67, in the prespectives
>  nuclear systems Such   ===> nuclear systems. Such
--> done.
