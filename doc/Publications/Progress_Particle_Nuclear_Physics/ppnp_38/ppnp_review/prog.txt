Dear Morten,

This is now finally the second referee report to your review article for
"Prog. Part. Nucl. Phys.2 of Dean et al.. I look forward to get the final
manusscript of your article.

With best regards
Amand.

Report of the second Referee for the Review paper of Dean et al.
>
>  The review is very interesting, self-contained, with the right portion of
formal
> many-body theory and discussion of experimental results. It gives a good
overview
>  of the present status of the subject and defines the state of the art for
the
> microscopic construction of effective interactions to be used in the
nuclear shell-model.
>
> Only one suggestion that the authors may consider useful for the paper, is
to add
> a comment on how to match or complement the shell-model description with
the fact that
> the single particle states are not fully occupied and that the strength of
the states,
> i.e. the single particle spectral functions are very spread in energy.
The reference
> to two recent publications  on this point in this same Journal can help to
> complete this bridge:
> "Self-consistent Green's function method for nuclei and nuclear matter" by
>  W.H. Dickhoff & C.  Barbieri, nuclth/0402034 to be published in Prog.
Part. Nucl. Phys.
> and " Two-body correlations in nuclear systems " by H. Muether and A.
Polls  in
> Prog. Part. Nucl. Phys. 45 (2000)243.

>
> Now some small things very easy to fix :
>
> 1) P^2 = p ==> P^2 =P   (after eq. (2))
>
> 2) Dyson eq. (31) should be with plus or minus sign ?

> 3) It can be useful for the reader to have a comment on why the factor

Dear Morten,

The second referee has me just informed, that he will finish the report for
your review article for "Prog. Part. Nucl. Phys." til Mach 8th. He writes:

"This time you did not give me so much time for the referee. I will try to
      have it ready on Monday 8th March. Sorry for the delay."

With best regards
Amand.

>   ----------------------------------------------------------
>
>    This paper contains an extensive review of microscopic shell model
>   calculations. For light nuclei such as those in the p-shell, one can
>   do Monte-Carlo Green's Function calculations or the so-called
>   no-core shell model calculations. But these methods are not capable
>   at all to treat heavy nuclei such as the tin isotopes. This paper
>   reports very impressive microscopic shell model calculations
>   for the tin isotopes. A non-saturation problem was discussed.
>   A Q-box folded diagram framework was used, with G-matrix
>   calculated from realistic NN potentials. It has a nice review of
>   the folded diagram method and the matrix inversion method for
calculating
>   the G-matrix with plane-wave intermediate states.
>
>     The parquet diagrams for the Q-box are discussed. It seems the authors
>   have not reported any figures or tables illustrating the importance
>   of parquet diagrams.  It may be nice to include some of these results.
>   For example, a comparison of results with Q-box
>   calculated with 1st+2nd, +3rd and +parquet diagrams.
>   It is not clear if the parquet diagrams are included for the
>   tin results reported. Application of coupled cluster methods to nuclear
>   structure is also discussed, rather briefly.  It may be perhaps
>   better to discuss this approach with a little more detail.
