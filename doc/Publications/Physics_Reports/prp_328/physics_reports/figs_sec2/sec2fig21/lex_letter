Hallo Morton,

Sorry for the delay,


First I now have more concrete ideas about what we can do on the URCA cooling.
Armen Sedrakian has arrived here as a postdoc and among other things
we are working out the (direct URCA) neutrino-antineutrino
emission both in the quasi-particle approximation (qpa) and
also with the use of the dressed fermion  propagators in the one-loop diagram.
Some of the formalism can be found in the Knoll-Voskresensky paper
(hep-ph/9510417, Ann Phys.)

I suggested to him that we could try to combine with your notes
on the charge changing direct URCA, which has the extra angle-dependence,
from last spring, which can probably also be generalised beyond qpa.
Do you agree with the idea?

The whole thing still requires some work.

I also have some questions about your notes;
 eg in eq 8 the dimension of the last
 term does not seem to be right, is there m^2 missing? Same with eq 29.

  Also I am wondering whether relations like 18 should be taken with bar
  or effective masses.

My question is : are you interested in a joined effort?
 In case case we could send you our notes on vbar{v} ,
 Eventually we could meet once we agree on the overall project.

Pairing and modified URCA require more discussion.

The other thing Armen started is the calculation of the Lambda
and Sigma spectral functions using  the G-matrix from the new
Nijmegen NY potentials (with some help of Rob for teh NY sector)
for beta equilibrium and finite T.
It might have some overlap with work other groups,
howver it seems that the Catania result is based upon a separable expansion
of the potential and we are not sure whether that is reliable.
Are you doing anything in that direction?


With best regards,
Lex
