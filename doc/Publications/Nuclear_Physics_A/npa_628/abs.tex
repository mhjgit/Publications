\begin{abstract}

The microscopic quasiparticle-phonon model, MQPM, is used to study
the energy spectra of the odd $Z=53 - 63$, $N=82$ isotones. 
The results are compared with experimental data, with the extreme
quasiparticle-phonon limit and with the results of an unrestricted 
$2s1d0g_{7/2}0h_{11/2}$ shell model (SM) calculation.
The interaction used in these calculations is a realistic 
two-body $G$-matrix interaction derived from modern meson-exchange 
potential models for the nucleon-nucleon interaction. 
For the shell model all the 
two-body matrix elements are renormalized by the $\hat{Q}$-box method 
whereas for the MQPM the effective interaction is defined by the $G$-matrix.
