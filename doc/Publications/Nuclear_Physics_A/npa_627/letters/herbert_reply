Dear Friends of the local and non-local interactions

I try to approach the differences from a slightly different point of view:
Go back to the calculation of phase shifts!!
 
What I have been doing is calculate the phase shifts by diagonalyzing
the two-body Hamiltonian in a Box of a fixed radius
(famous box method of Arturo Polls and others).
Since all interactions fit the same NN phase shifts, the eigenvalues
which we obtain should (and are) identical for the various NN interactions.
What is different is the different wavefunctions which we obtain for
the different NN interactions at one given energy. Again asymptotically
the wave functions are identical, not, however, in the region of the
NN interaction.

The situation is similar to nucleon-nucleus scattering. Also there one has
local and non-local potentials leading to the same phase shifts. But the
wave functions in that regime where V is different from zero exhibits
typical differences, the famous Perey factor. Is there a similar Perey
factor also between local and non-local forces for NN scattering? Until 
now I tried cdBonn and Argonne potential in 1S0 partial wave. What I observe
is that the Bonn wave function is "smoother" at small r than the Argonne 
one (in line with the Perey factor argument). Now going to the medium, it 
will be more difficult to generate the same correlated wave function for
the Argonne potential therefore the 1S0 contribution to the binding energy
shall be less attractive .....

In order to see whether this differences are quite general, I should
explore the differences for the other potentials and in other partial waves.

For that purpose I would need
1) Program to generate Nijmegen potentials in momentum space (it would be
best to have them in a calling form similar to the Bonn potentials)

2) Arturo: What to do for coupled (tensor) channels? Did you not extend the
box method to Tensor channels as well? What is the reference?

Best regards    Herbert
