6Dear Artur, Herbert, Lars and Ruprecht,

below you'll find a kind of sketch of a paper on the symmetry
energy and proton fractions in neutron star matter.
It is by no means a final draft. Rather, I'd like to hear your comments
and ideas before I embark on a dull calculation of the proton fractions.
Thereafter, I'll finalize a draft and send it to you. However, at certain
stages one needs some feedback.

The calcs of the sym energy have been done with the most modern
pots on the market, cd-bonn, nijm I and II abd v18.
They are fit to the same data and have an excellent \chi^2 per datum.
Nobody can come and say that the results are due to "poor" pots.

The two first pots contain non-local operators in the NN pot, while
v18 and Njim II are purely local by construct. 
These pots allows us therefore in a rather clear way to disentagle
differences which are due to off-shell effects from non-local
pieces.
Some people will not like the conclusions, I had quite some discs
with Pandharipande about the topics discussed in the draft, and if
we want to continue with the paper and even publish it,
we may have some hard time.........

The results and disc are meant to address the following more or
less accepted half-truths/misconceptions etc.

1) only relativistic calcs can give rising symmetry energy and
   proton fractions
2) the difference between various calcs are due to different methods
   and inclusion of three-body forces (see e.g the ref to
   Prakash in the ms). Especially many people look at the
   calcs of wiringa et al in 1988 as the truth
3) there is pion condensation at higher densities.......(vijay)


I have not yet plotted in figs 1-3 (included below as uuencoded
figs) the v18 results (they are not so different from Nijm II).
The proton fractions are not done, but i can say that 
they will drop with v18 and nimj II.
Obviously, the different proton fractions may change 
quite a lot the neutron star cooling scenarios. However,
since the EOS in fig 2 are very similar, mass and radius of
the star will be the same.


All the best,
Morten

\begin{abstract}

In this work we show that nucleon-nucleon potentials which 
include only local operators
yield rather different proton fractions 
and symmetry energies than
non-local potentials contructed  from relativistic 
meson-exchange models. 
The symmetry energy
tends to saturate
at densities around 2-3 times
nuclear matter for local potentials, while it increases 
for potentials which are non-local. The differences can be attributed
to the off-shell behavior of the non-local potentials.

The equation of state (EOS) for neutron star matter and infinite
nuclear matter has been intesively studied the last years.
A correct description of the EOS would have  far reaching consequences
for topics ranging  from the cooling of neutron stars
to the physics of heavy ion collisions.
Several approaches to derive the EOS exit in the literature,
see e.g.\ Refs. \cite{pr95,prakash94,ms93,hko95} 
for some recent reviews. 
In most approaches to infinite nuclear matter, and finite nuclei as
well,
one aims at describing the properties of these systems in terms
of  the free nucleon-nucleon potential (NN). 
By construction,  the NN interaction reproduces the 
two-nucleon scattering data and the properties of the deuteron.
At present, there are several high-quality phenomenological models of the NN 
interaction based on meson exchange. These NN interactions 
\cite{cdbonn,nim,v18} are fit to scattering data on the energy shell, that is
for processes in which the two nucleons have the same energy 
before and after the interaction. 
However, in a nuclear many-body environment, the two nucleons may have
different energies before and after they interact. Thus, in calculating
properties of infinite nuclear matter, there are also so-called 
off-shell contributions  from the NN interaction
to different terms in the many-body scheme. These contributions 
can not be
determined by the scattering data, and different approaches to the
construction of the NN interaction  may therefore yield e.g.,
different binding energies in nuclear matter. Only careful
studies of nuclear observables can help in discriminating
between various potentials. 
Since several many-body
schemes and potentials are used in the literature, it is often
difficult to disentagle the origin of discrepancies between the 
derived  equations of state and various observables.    

The aim of this work is therefore to show that
when employing the same many-body scheme, 
different approximations to the NN potential
result in  rather different neutron star properties. 
The potentials we will employ here are the recent models
of the Nijmegen group \cite{nim}, the charge-dependent
version \cite{cdbonn} of the Bonn potentials \cite{mac89} and
the Argonne $V_{18}$ potential \cite{v18}. In 1993, the Nijmegen group
presented a phase-shift analysis of all proton-proton and neutron-proton
data below $350$ MeV in lab energy with a $\chi^2$ per datum of $0.99$
for 4301 data entries. The above potentials have all been contructed
based on these data. The charge-dependent Bonn potential has 
a $\chi^2$ per datum of $1.03$, the same is the case for the Nijm I and II
versions of the Nijmegen group \cite{nim}. The new Argonne
potential \cite{v18} has a $\chi^2$ per datum of $1.09$. 
However, the reader should note that, although on a statistical
ground the potentials are as accurate as they can be, the way they
are constructed is different. The Argonne potential and the 
Nijm II potential are non-relativistic potential models which
include only local operators, either in coordinate space or momentum space.
Such approaches to the NN potential have been much favored since they
are numerically easy to use in configuration space calculations.
The off-shell effects of these two potentials are very similar
\cite{cdbonn}. 
The Nijm I model is similar to the Nijm II model, but, it has 
also a non-local momentum dependent contribution to the 
central force of the NN interaction, see Eq.\ (13) of Ref.\ 
\cite{nim}. As we will show
below, this distinction between the Nijm I and II potentials yields
non-neglible off-shell effects. Moreover, since both potentials
fit almost exactly the available data, one has a clear way
of studying the differences between purely local and non-local
approaches to the NN interaction. The charge dependent Bonn
potential is based on the relativistic meson-exchange potentials
of Ref.\ \cite{mac89}.  Meson-exchange is mainly responsible for
the long-range and intermediate range of the nuclear force. 
Such models will therefore only include parts of the full
non-locality of the NN interaction. 
However, even the one-pion exchange contribution is non-local
in a relativistic meson-exchange model,
and only when the particles are on-shell and one takes the 
non-relativistic limit does the one-pion
exchange contribution to the NN interaction become local, 
see e.g., Eq.\ (8) 
of Ref.\ \cite{cdbonn}. Thus, 
the non-locality affects the one-pion exchange only off-shell.
This has however important consequences for the tensor force
of the NN interaction and thereby for the binding energy per
particle in nuclear matter or finite nuclei, as discussed in 
Ref.\ \cite{hko95}.


The neutron star properties we have in mind here 
are the symmetry energy and the 
proton fractions for $\beta$-stable matter, being of
importance for the cooling history of neutron stars \cite{pr95,prakash94}.
The symmetry energy ${\cal S}(n)$ is defined as the difference between
the energy per particle in pure neutron matter ${\cal E}(n,x_p=0)$ and 
the binding energy per particle in symmetric nuclear 
matter ${\cal E}(n,x_p=1/2)$, where $n$ is the total baryon density
in units of fm$^{-3}$ and $x_p=n_p/n$ is the proton fraction. 
The total baryon density is given by $n=n_p+n_n$, where $n_p$ and
$n_n$ refer to the proton and neutron densities, respectively.
The symmetry energy can in turn be related to
the proton fraction in $\beta$-stable matter.  To see this one can
expand the energy per particle in terms of the proton fraction
$x_p$ around ${\cal E}(n,x_p=1/2)$ as
\begin{equation}
      {\cal E}(n,x_p)={\cal E}(n,x_p=1/2)+
      {\cal S}(n)\left(1-x_p\right)^2+\dots,
      \label{eq:energy}
\end{equation}
and using the equilibrium condition for $\beta$-stable matter with
protons, neutrons and ultrarelativistic electrons
\begin{equation}
      \mu_e=\mu_n-\mu_p=
      -\left(\partial{\cal E}(n,x_p)/\partial x_p\right),
\end{equation} 
and keeping only terms up to quadratic order in $x_p$ in Eq.\
(\ref{eq:energy}) \cite{prakash94},
one finds that the proton fraction is related to the symmetry energy through
\begin{equation}
     \left(3\pi^2nx_p\right)^{1/3}=4 {\cal S}(n)\left(1-x_p\right).
\end{equation}
The proton fraction is in turn important for the cooling history of
a neutron star. At a certain critical value, typically $x_p \approx 0.15$,
the so-called direct Urca processes for neutrino emissions 
are allowed \cite{pr95,prakash94}. Further, neutrino emissivity 
 from the so-called modified Urca processes do also
depend on the given proton fractions, see e.g., Ref.\ \cite{fm79}. 
In most calculations of neutronic matter, non-relativistic 
hamiltonians have been used, see e.g., Ref.\ \cite{wff88}. These
calculations, which employed local NN interactions, gave a 
symmetry energy which saturated at densities around 2-3 times
nuclear matter saturation density $n_0=0.17$ fm$^{-3}$. The 
proton fraction would then also stabilize, or even decrease 
\cite{prakash94,wff88}, and would typically never reach the critical 
proton fraction needed   for the direct Urca process.
Calculations performed within a relativistic inspired approach,
such as the Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach, gave on the other
hand a steadily increasing with density proton fraction, see 
e.g., Ref.\ \cite{ehobo96}. 
Common knowledge has then been that the increasing proton fractions
arised  from the fact that one was performing 
a relativistic calculations \cite{tt96}. In Ref.\ \cite{prakash94},
the difference between various non-relativistic results, obtained
with various many-body schemes, 
for the symmetry energy and the proton fractions
was ascribed to the role of three-body forces. 

It is however our belief here that the discrepancy can be retraced to
the use of different two-body NN potentials, and that there is no need
to invoke relativistic calculations. 
The many-body method we will employ in deriving the symmetry energy and the 
relevant proton fractions is the
simplest possible, the non-relativistic 
summation of particle-particle ladder
diagrams only, the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) method. 
Here it will
serve us as a mere tool to investigate various NN potentials so that
the discrepancies observed can be retraced to the  NN 
potentials only. 
Before we proceed, we feel also that 
a disclaimer is necessary. We do not, by obvious reasons,
believe
that a non-relativistic BHF scheme offers a realistic approach to matter at
densities above nuclear matter saturation density $\rho_0=0.17$ fm$^{-3}$.
Other many-body contributions such as three-body effects, screening etc.\
are definetely important in order to reproduce the data. 
Moreover, accounting only for nucleonic degrees of freedom 
should be viewed as a nothing but a first approximation. There is no
reason why other baryons should not be present at higher densities.
However, albeit the shortcomings of the many-body approach 
used in our demonstration, 
it serves
the aim of this work, namely to demonstrate that irrespective
of method, potentials which are local miss terms which become
important at higher densities. This is in turn a warning if one wishes
to include interactions between nucleons and other baryons, of relevance
for higher densities. There is no guarantee for this case as well that
off-shell effects  from non-local terms would play a negligible role. 

The energy per particle ${\cal E}(n,x_p)$ within the BHF scheme is 
given in terms of the 
so-called reaction matrix $G$. The latter is obtained by solving the
Bethe-Goldstone equation for proton fractions $x_p$ \cite{ehobo96}
\begin{equation}
       G(\omega ,x_p )=V+VQ\frac{Q(x_p)}{\omega - H_0}G(\omega ,x_p),
       \label{eq:bg}
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the unperturbed energy of the interacting  nucleons,
$V$ is the free NN potential, $H_0$ is the unperturbed energy of the
intermediate scattering states,
and $Q(x_p)$ is the Pauli
operator preventing scattering into occupied states.
Only ladder diagrams with intermediate two-particle states are included
in Eq.\ (\ref{eq:bg}). 
With the $G$-matrix we have 
\begin{equation}
        {\cal E}(n,x_p)=T+\sum _{ab} 
         n_a n_b\langle ab\vert G(\omega =
         \epsilon _a + \epsilon _b ,x_p)\vert ab\rangle,
        \label{eq:g_bhf}
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the total kinetic energy
an the n's are the unperturbed Fermi-Dirac distribution functions,
namely $n_k$ =1 if $k\leq k_F$ and =0 if $k>k_F$ where  $k_F$ is the 
Fermi momentum.
The  sp energies are denoted
by $\epsilon$, and are determined self-consistently using the BHF theory,
see Ref.\ \cite{hko95} for further details. 

In Fig.\ \ref{fig:fig1} we plot the binding energy per particle
for symmetric nuclear matter for the four potentials employed,
the charge-dependent Bonn potential \cite{cdbonn}(solid line), the two
Nijmegen potentials Nijm I (long dashes) 
and II (short dashes) \cite{nim} and the 
Argonne potential (dotted line) \cite{v18}. In Fig.\ \ref{fig:fig2} we display
the energy per particle in pure neutron matter for the same potentials, while
the symmetry energy ${\cal S}(n)$ is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:fig3}.

Fig.\ \ref{fig:fig1} displays 
a common problem of non-relativistic nuclear matter calculations, namely  
the
simultaneous reproduction of both the binding  energy per nucleon
($BE/A=16\pm 1$ MeV) and the saturation density
$n_0=0.17$ fm$^{-3}$.
If for a given interaction
one is able to predict the saturation density, then the binding energy
is underestimated. Similarly, if one is able to reproduce the
binding energy of nuclear matter, then the saturation density is
too high. This results in the so-called Coester band, where the saturation
point for a given nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction
is correlated with the strength of the tensor force in the NN interaction.
An important difference between the charge-dependent Bonn potential
and the Argonne and Nimjegen potentials is the strength of the much debated
tensor force \cite{bm94}. The Bonn potential has 
a smaller $^{3}D_1$-state admixture in the deuteron $^{3}S_1$
ground state
than the Argonne and Nimjegen potentials \cite{cdbonn}.
A smaller(larger) $D$-state
admixture in the ground state of the deuteron 
means that the tensor force is weaker(stronger).
The strength of the tensor force has in turn important consequences 
in calculations of the binding energy for both
finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter, see e.g., the discussion
in Ref.\ \cite{hko95}. A potential model  with a weak tensor force
yields more attraction in a nuclear system than a 
potential with a strong tensor force. This is clearly seen in
Fig.\ \ref{fig:fig1} where a partial wave analysis 
of the contributions to the binding energy shows that the largest
differences  between the Bonn, the Nijm I and II and the Argonne
potentials arise  from the $^{3}S_1$ partial wave. 
The Nijm I has a weaker 
tensor force compared to Nijm II and the Argonne potential.
The strength of the tensor force is also reflected in the
calculation of the binding energy of the triton in Ref.\ \cite{cdbonn}.
The Bonn potential yields a binding energy of $8.00$ MeV, the 
Nijm I potential gives $7.72$ MeV while the Nijm II and the Argonne
potentials yield $7.62$ MeV.  Both the Nijm II and the Argonne potentials
contain only local operators in the NN interaction and their
off-shell effects are very similar, as can be seen  from the
binding energy of nuclear matter in Fig.\ \ref{fig:fig1} and the
triton. Thus, the differences between off-shell effects 
due to non-local terms in the construction of the NN potential
are seen  mainly in the contribution  from the tensor force
to the $^{3}S_1$ partial wave. 
For partial waves with $J\geq 1$ the differences between the various
potentials are small, typically less than $5\%$.
The differences between the local and the non-local
potentials in Fig.\ \ref{fig:fig2} is 
due to 
the contribution  from the $^1S_0$ channel, and can be ascribed to the 
non-local terms in the NN interaction.

The differences  in binding energies of Fig.\ \ref{fig:fig1} are in turn
reflected in the symmetry energy of Fig.\ \ref{fig:fig3}. 
These results clearly show that the non-saturation of the symmetry energy
is mainly due to off-shell effects arising  from non-local
terms in the tensor force contribution to the $^3S_1$ partial wave.
It ought to be mentioned that the symmetry energy of
the Bonn and Nijm I potentials saturates as well, but 
at densities between $0.6-0.7$ fm$^{-3}$. However, 
at e.g., densities
like $0.5$ fm$^{-3}$ or higher in pure neutron matter one is far beyond
the energy region where the NN potentials have been fitted.
One can therefore not expect any reliable results in these density
regions.
This is also the reason why we do not plot results for higher densities
in Figs.\ \ref{fig:fig1}-\ref{fig:fig3}. 

Finally, in Fig.\ \ref{fig:fig4} we show the resulting
proton fractions in $\beta$-stable matter. 
The proton fraction in $\beta$--equilibrium is
determined by imposing the relevant equilibrium conditions on the processes
$e^{-}+p \rightarrow n+\nu_{e}$
and $e^{-}\rightarrow \mu^{-}+\overline{\nu}_{\mu}+\nu_{e}$.
The conditions for $\beta$--equilibrium require that 
$\mu_{n}=\mu_{p}+\mu_{e}$,
where $\mu_{i}$ is the chemical potential of particle species $i$ ,
and that 
charge is conserved 
$n_{p}=n_{e}$.
We do not include muons. We also assumed that the neutrinos do 
not contribute.
The proton and neutron chemical potentials are determined  from 
the energy per particle ${\cal E}(n,x_p)$.
