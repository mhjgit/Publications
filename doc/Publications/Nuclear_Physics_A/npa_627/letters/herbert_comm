Dear Morten, Lars, Ruprecht and Arturo,

I am not as fast as Ruprecht in understanding the differences between
local and non-local NN interactions and their predictions on symmetry
energies in particular at high densities. Also I am not really sure whether 
I have understood this difference at all. Let me try to summarize what
I think we can deduce from our results:

1) Figur 1: There has been a difference in the predictions of symmetry
 energies between variational or CBF kind of calculations using essentially
 V14 potential and BHF calculations using OBE potentials. The former obtained
 a stabilization of the symmetry energy resulting from NN forces while the
 BHF (OBE) calculations yield an increase of the symmetry energy even at high
 density. Our figure 1 shows that this difference is not due to the method 
 (BHF versus variational) but due to the interaction. 

2) Local versus nonlocal potentials in 1s0 channel: The contribution to the
 energy is calculated from matrix elements of G, which are diagonal in the 
relative momentum q: G(q). G(q) or T(q) is less atrractive with increasing q.
This is also true for V(q) = V_direct(momentum transfer=zero) - V_exchange
For a local potential, the direct contribution is independent on q, while for
a non-local (if it is of OBE kind) already the direct contribution contains
a q-dependence such that V_direct(q) get less attractive with increasing q.
All potentials (local and nonlocal) are fitted to describe
phase shifts:
T(q)=V_local(q)+Delta_local(q) = V_nl(q)+Delta_nl(q)
(Delta=T-V)
Local potentials require a larger attractive Delta then non-local
in order that T(q) can exhibit the same q-dependence. 
Going from T to G, the Delta-contribution gets quenched leading to a G
which is less attractive than T. This effect is larger for local than for
non-local potentials. That is what is confirmed in Fig. 4

3) The same feature can also be observed in the 3S1 channel. However, in this
case the differences local versus non-local are overwhelmed by the effects
of the tensor force. Note that the 3 Nijmegen potentials have essentially the
same d-state probability (5.66 percent), the non-local version shows more
attraction then the local Nijmegen potentials. The cdBonn, however, has a 
weaker tensor (d-state 4.8 percent) therefore it is much more attractive in
this channel than the other two. This explains Fig. 3

4) How can we understand the large differences in the channels with l.le.1?
I am not so sure about this point but I think it is probably the most important
for the understanding of the symmetry energy:
The G-matrix in these partial waves is dominated by the Born term. The q-
dependence of these Born terms for local and non-local potentials is as we
discussed in 2). This would explain the behavior of the Bonn results in Fig.5 
and 7 , I cannot explain the behvior of Nijm1 in Fig.5.

5) Also my results for the Ruhrpot dont fit into the picture developed so far:
Also the ruhrpot is non-local, it yields a symmetry energy increasing with
density as cdBonn. The behavior in the l=0 channels, hwoever, is quite 
different (see tables at the end of this message).

6) It seems that we can understand some features and mechanisms relating 
symmetry energy and NN interaction. I myself, however, do not feel satisfied
yet. We should try to work out the points which I try to make under 2-4)
more in detail. If we simply state results for potentials x,y and z, people 
may ask, so what? 

7) What about the differences in the momentum-dependence of the
single-particle energies. This could give us an additional clou.

8) Shall we try to incorporate the Ruhrpot results (as listed below)? I
could go up to higher densities, if we think that is what is needed.

Best regards                 Herbert
