Dear Gang-of-Four,

the mail battle is raging, and that's fun!
Ultimately we will all learn something we didn't know,
even though we all thought, we knew everything.

In this message, I will be short and, essentially,
technical; give me until next week concerning some details
(short of time, in the moment).

Concerning IDPAR in the Nijmegen code:
Believe it or not, but the Nijmegen people
do not understand their own code.
IDPAR=0 is Nijm93,
IDPAR=1 is Nijm-I,
IDPAR=2 is Nijm-II,
this is what is correct;
and what the Nijmegen people say in their own code is wrong.
I have checked this very thoroughly, reproduced
all the phase shifts and deuteron properties EXACTLY
with the above assignments.
(Based upon this, one can only hope, that the Nijmegen people
know otherwise what they are doing.)

The important and outstanding thing about these new, high-precision
NN potentials (i.e., CD-Bonn, Nijm-I, Nijm-II, Reid93) is that
their \chi^2/datum is ONE. Thus differences in the reuslts
cannot be attributed anymore to fit differences and, thus, one is
finally in the unique position to pin down off-shell differences.
This is the purpose of our paper (as I understand it).

The Nijm93 and the Ruhrpot potentials do NOT have this
chi^2/datum of one; Nijm93 has 1.9 and Ruhrpot has 1.7.
This is more like the old potentials (Reid68, Paris, V_{14}, etc).
Thus, there may be large on-shell diffrences which obscure
the investigation (like those in Fig. 1).
For this reason, I like to suggest to exclude Nijm93 and Ruhrpot.

Plotting the potentials in momentum space is more
revealing. I have done that, but give me time until next
week to reprot on this in detail.

The reason why Nijm-II behaves so "odd" in Fig. 5 is the
1P1 contribution (which is absent in Fig. 7): Nijm-II has
an unusually large (repulsive) 1P1 contribution.
The reason for this, I do not know yet; it has to be
off-shell, because on-shell the 1P1 phase shift is not
more repulsive than that of the other potentials
(cf. for this always Table V of PRC 49, 2950 (1994)).

With best regards,

Ruprecht.
