Dear Morten,

I like the draft of the paper "Non-local and local ..."
very much and have only a few, essentially technical,
comments.

I suggest to modify the title to: "Non-local vs. local ..."

Page 3, beginning of last paragraph:
(I should note here that I printed out the paper WITHOUT
the multicolmn option; this may mix-up page and paragraph #'s.)
"The Nijm-I has a weaker tensor force compared to Nijm-II
potential." This is not true. Nijm-I has P_D=5.66% and
Nijm-II has P_D=5.64.
My observation is that the larger attraction of Nijm-I as compared
to Nijm-II comes from the 1S0, where Nijm-I is more attractive
than Nijm-II. The reason for this is that in 1S0 the nonlocality
in the central force shows up. Nijm-I is nonlocal in the central
force, while Nijm-II is local everywhere.
CD-Bonn is nonlocal everywhere, in particular, nonlocal in the
central force and in the tensor force.
Therefore, Nijm-I and CD-Bonn agree in 1S0 (which is the reason
for their agreement in Fig. 3, but differ from Nijm-II),
but disagree in 3S1 where also the nonlocality of the
tensor force comes in (which the Nijm-I doesn't have).

The URCA process, if it occurs: Is it supposed to occur at
a particular density?  Or can it even occur at densities
around 1 fm^{-3}?
If so, then the CD-Bonn can give rise to URCA,
since it can easily reach a \chi_p greater
than 0.11 around 1 fm^{-3}.
What this means is that with just a realistic non-local 2N potential
(and without 3N forces and/or relativity) URCA can happen.
Therefore, I suggest to make this statement on page 4, 3. paragraph
from top, NOT SO STRONG. You are saying there that 
"for none of the above potentials will the proton fraction 
reach the critical value needed for the direct URCA process."
I believe, it's one important point of this paper that
with realistic non-local ones you can reach it, or at leasts
can come terribly close to it, while for local ones
it's totally hopeless.
True is that the potentials are fit up to Tlab=350 MeV, but you 
can "stretch" them to about 500 MeV, because there is no substantial
inelasticity below 500 MeV. In my estimate, Tlab=500 MeV is
equivalent to a (Fermi) momentum of 2.46 fm^{-1} which
is equivalent to a density of 1 fm^{-3}.

Second paragraph of CONCLUSIONS:
I think one should not cast so much doubt on where the nonlocal terms
come from. The nonlocal terms are not doubtful and do not have
an obscure source.  They come from exactly the same source the local
terms come from: from meson exchange, in terms of a straightforward
calculation in which nothing is skipped. 
If some people find nonlocal terms doubtful, then I find their
local terms equally doubtful.
The fact that you cannot directly constrain them by experiment,
does not make them obscure. Local and nonlocal potential
terms are constrained by
experiment equally indirectly.
Notice that none is equal to the on-shell T-matrix which is the only
thing constrained by experiment.
Let's not run here into the traps of people who put
them out because their theory is so poor and, therefore,
like to put the scale of values up-side-down.
THE CONSISTENT THEORY RESULTS IN A NONLOCAL POTENTIAL
AND IS THEREFORE THE BETTER ONE.


Some technicallities:

1. The first time you mention it, you might say
   " ... the new, charge-dependent Bonn potential (CD-Bonn) ..."
   and then, I suggest, just call it alway CD-Bonn. This is better, because
   besides being charge-dependent, an equally important point
   is that it has a better fit. CD-Bonn is then just a label
   for everything it contains.

2. Ref. 5: The authors are correct, but the ref. for the Nijm. POTS. is
   Phys. Rev. C 49, 2950 (1994).
   (The other ref. is the one for the Nijmegen ANALYSIS.)

3. Typos that occured to me:
   First sentence of manuscript: "... has been inteNsively
   studied FOR MANY YEARS."
   Third sentence: "...  to derive the EOS exiSt in the ..."
   Last sentence of this paragraph: "... difficult to
   disentaNgle the origin ..."

   Page 2, last paragraph, end of first sentence:
   "... NN potentials, without THE NEED to invoke ..."

   Below Eq. (6): "... kinetic energy anD the ..."

   Page 3, middle of last paragraph:
   "For partial waves with $L \geq 1$ ..."
   (I suggest here to use L instead of J.)


With best regards,

Ruprecht.
