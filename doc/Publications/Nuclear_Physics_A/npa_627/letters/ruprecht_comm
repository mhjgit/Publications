Dear Morten,

the neutron-star paper has developed into a really great
paper. What the non-locality in different parts of the nuclear
force does, comes out very clearly, now.
In particular, I like those Figs. 3 and 4: Fig. 4 demonstrates
clearly what nonlocality in the central force does; very convincing,
since you have two locals and two nonlocals and they both agree.
Then, Fig. 3 shows clearly the additional effect of the nonlocal
tensor force. Also very clear: the nonlocality in the tensor
force is the largest effect.

There are only a few remarks that I'd like to make:

For local potentials, you sometimes use the term "potentials
that include only local operators". That may be misleading,
because the L.S operator, which any (local or nonlocal) potential
includes, is a non-local operator.
It may be better to say simply "local function" instead of
"local operator" in those places.

The "disclaimer" on p. 6, middle, I feel, is somewhat too strong.
A referee may turn this against us and say: well, you yourself admit
it's all unrealistic, so it's not worth publishing.
BHF is not a complete calculation, including all possible effects,
but it's an important contribution, the largest of all, and thus
an important first approach.

On page 12, middle, you mention the contribution from 3-body
forces (3BF). On line 9/10 from the top, it is stated:
"Three-body forces are KNOWN to add repulsion at higher
densities [5]."
And 4 lines below this: "...the rise in symmetry energy and proton
fractions due to the inclusion of three-body forces ... is CLEAR."

The truth is: nothing is KNOWN and nothing is CLEAR.

We do not have a reliable theory for the three-body force,
and as long as we don't have it, we know nothing reliably.
The only thing there is, are some purely phenomenological
3BF that are pure fit products to get some "good" results
for light nuclei, and they do whatever they do.

Thus, I feel, the only correct statement one can make is,
that IN THE CALCULATIONS OF REF ... the particular 3NF  
THAT IS USED IN THAT PARTICULAR WORK 
(and that has now foundation and no general validity) happens
to be repulsive at higher densities and happens to rise
the the symmetry energy and proton fractions.
However, one day when we will hopefully have a reliable theory
of the 3BF, then it may be all quite different (it could
well be opposite); we simply do not know.


Some merely "technical" stuff:

page 4, top: title of Section II: May be better:
             "Results and Discussion"

page 7, line 8 from top: may be better: " ... H_0 is the
unperturbed Hamiltonian, and ..."

page 8, line 8/9 from bottom: " ... contribution from
the $^3S_1$ partial wave to the 
potential energy ... "  [ no `in the contribution']

page 9, line 6/7 from bottom: " ... Bonn potential
yields a TRITON binding energy of ... 
... yields 7.62 MeV, the same as the new Argonne potential [9]."
[ no `does']

page 13, 4 from top: " ... note that theRE are ... "

page 13, last line (of Acknowledgement):
" ... are greatFULLY acknowledged."



I like, of course, also this Fig. 9 which clearly shows:
the more nonlocality the higher the proton fractions,
and the Bonn gives easily rise to URCA.
So here we have a "measurable" difference, in case the
3BF stuff all turns out to be a flopp one day
(in the year of 2050, when we are all dead).


I always prefer PRC (which costs no publications fees
when you submit your REVTEX file; only reprints would cost something,
but one doesn't need them anymore),
however, NPA is also fine with me.
But I would not consider any other journals; they would all
be lower level.

All the best,

Ruprecht.
