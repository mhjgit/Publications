Dear Dr. Hjorth-Jensen,

The above paper has just returned from the referee with the attached
report, in view of which we look forward to receiving a revised version 
of your work in due course.

Yours sincerely,

**********************************************************************
Referee's report on: Modern nucleon-nucleon potentials and symmetry 
                     energy in infinite matter

This paper presents a very thorough study of the symmetry energy and other
energetic properties of infinite nucleon matter.  This study is important
in that it is based on the most realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions
currently on the market, potentials that achieve precision fits of
a recently updated body of nucleon-nucleon scattering data and are
essentially phase-shift equivalent.  The paper will have significant 
impact by virtue of the insights it provides into the differences between 
these competing potential models, differences that may be traced mainly 
to the treatment of non-localities.  I predict that it will be cited
for many years to come.  The work is quite timely, as fundamental nuclear 
many-body theory is experiencing a modest revival due, in large part, to 
the development of this new generation of NN potentials.

It is true that the actual predictions for the symmetry energy, potential
energy, proton fraction, etc., cannot be taken seriously at the higher
densities considered in this study.  The non-relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-
Fock description simply cannot be trusted at such high densities (an
order of magnitude greater than the central density in ordinary nuclei).  
Three-body forces, many-body clusters, relativity, exotic baryons, quark or 
kaon condensation, and quark/gluon structure could, in some combination,
change the picture substantially.  However, the detailed and systematic
investigation that has been carried out will remain of high value as a
baseline for more elaborate treatments.

I can strongly recommend publication of this paper in Nucl. Phys. A.

The paper is very well written and I have detected relatively few mistakes
and misprints.  However, a few stylistic or grammatical lapses, and
a couple of glitches, should be corrected:

page 5, line 12: To avoid misunderstanding, it would be better to omit
   the phrase "which represents the Born approximation to the R matrix".
   The Born approximation has already been identified.

page 5, line 2 from bottom:  "are getting smaller" --> decrease  

page 6, Fig. 3:  1 subscript missing from the S-state symbol, and 3 
   superscript missing from the D-state symbol, in the lower plot.

page 8, line 17:  The sentence ending with "Akmal and Pandharipande [22]"
   appears to be incomplete.

eq. (3):  I'm not sure this (the G-matrix equation, usually considered as
   an integral equation) should be called the Bethe-Goldstone equation,
   which is strictly an equation for the Bethe-Goldstone wave function.
   
page 10, line 25:  Sentence ending "more attraction in" is incomplete.

page 16, last line: Use a semicolon instead of a comma.

page 17, line 12: "being" --> "is"

page 18, line 13: "directly" should be deleted -- it is redundant.

page 18, line 17: What exactly is meant by a "stiffer" symmetry energy?
