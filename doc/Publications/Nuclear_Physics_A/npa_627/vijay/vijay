Dear Mortan:

Arya Akmal, Geoff Ravenhall and myself have started writing our paper 
on dense matter and neutron stars.  We would like to compare our 
results for Argonne V18 with those in your paper with Engvik, Machleidt,
Muther and Polls.  

Could you please send us Tables for your curves in figures:
8. energy of symmetric nuclear matter
9. energy of pure neutron matter
10. symmetry energy
11. proton fraction 
12. eq. of state for beta stable matter.
We can read the numbers from the figures, but there is some error in 
that.

In general our results are not too different from yours, and we will 
send you the tables in a few days.

One point bothers me.  You gave us results for pure neutron matter 
in Trento.  They seem to be slightly different from the neutron 
matter energies we get from from the potential energies given in 
your fig. 9.  Could you please check and let us know which we 
should use for comparison.

With best wishes and Happy New Year,

Vijay
