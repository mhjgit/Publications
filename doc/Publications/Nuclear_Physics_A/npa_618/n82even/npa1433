Dear Dr. Hjorth-Jensen,



The paper 

Extended shell model calculation for even $N$ = 82 isotones with a realistic effective interaction

by 

A. Holt, T. Engeland, E. Osnes, M. Hjorth-Jensen and J. Suhonen

has been accepted for publication in Nuclear Physics A.


Your LaTeX file has been forwarded to the LOG-IN
Department and will be used for production purposes unless
you are notified by them that you paper will be typeset and
printed in the traditional manner.


In conjunction with the Copy-Editing and Issue-Management 
Department we are continuing our efforts to speed up the 
publication process. Many authors have informed us that they 
no longer need to see proofs of their paper if their LaTeX 
files are used for production purposes. IF YOU DO NOT WANT 
TO RECEIVE PROOFS PLEASE ADVISE THE ISSUE MANAGEMENT of this 
within three days of receipt of this notification.

Please bear in mind that proofs (of either typeset
manuscripts or produced from LaTeX files) must be returned
within 48 hours of receipt, preferably by fax. If no reply
is received from the author, the publisher will assume 
there are no further corrections to be made and will proceed
with publication of the article (see also the instructions
to contributors on the inside cover pages of the journal).

Requests for proofs, the return of original figures (if
required), and all further correspondence concerning 
post-acceptance matters should be directed to:
