\begin{abstract}
The shell model within the $2s1d0g_{7/2}0h_{11/2}$ shell is applied to 
calculate nuclear structure properties of the even $Z=52 - 62$, $N=82$ 
isotones. The results are compared with experimental data and with the 
results of a quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) calculation.
The interaction used in these calculations is a realistic 
two-body $G$-matrix
interaction derived from modern meson-exchange potential models for the
nucleon-nucleon interaction. 
For the shell model all the 
two-body matrix elements are renormalized by the $\hat{Q}$-box method 
whereas for the QRPA the effective interaction is defined 
by the $G$-matrix.
