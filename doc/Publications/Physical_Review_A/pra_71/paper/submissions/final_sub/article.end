\@doendnote{endnote24}{To a give a feeling for the numerical accuracy of our VMC results, we list here GP, MGP and VMC results in the dilute limit. We employ $N=500$ particles and a scattering length for $^{87}$Rb considered by Dalfovo and Stringari in Ref.\protect \nobreakspace  {}\cite {dalstr96}, which in units of the oscillator parameter perpendicular to the $z$-axis is $4.33\times 10^{-3}$. We obtain energies in units of the oscillator energy of 3.3032151, 3.3080392 and 3.3241881(10) for GP, MGP and VMC calculations, respectively. The VMC results are for an optimum variational parameter $\alpha = 0.475$. Taking into account that the two-body correlation has been kept fixed, and that the only variational parameter is $\alpha $, this result indicates that our ansazt for the variational wave function is rather. Actually, as the reader will notice from the discussion below, this discrepancy of roughly $0.5\%$ is of the same relative order as for the higher density cases reported below.}
