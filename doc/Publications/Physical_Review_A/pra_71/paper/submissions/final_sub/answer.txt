First of all we would like to use this opportunity to thank the 
referee for her/his kind remarks on our manuscript. Thanks also for spotting  
various typos. We have corrected these, in addition to some other ones as well. 

Moreover, in connection with the remark below

we have performed additional calculations in the low-density region, where
GP works well. These results are for the ground state only 
and we use a scattering length 
for 87Rb, employed by Stringari and Dalfovo in 
(PRA53(1996)2477) which in units of the oscillator parameter 
perpendicular to the z-axis  reads 4.33e-3. The calculations reported below are for
N=500 particles. Only the energy is included in the revised discussion.

The GP results are
Energy = 3.3032151


The corresponding  MGP results are:
Energy = 3.3080392


The VMC results are for an optimum variational parameter alpha= 0.475
and yield an energy 
Eenergy = 3.3241881(10)

Taking into account
that the two-body correlation has been kept fixed, and that the
only variational parameter is alpha, this result indicates that
the wave function is not so bad! Actually, the discrepancy is
of the same relative order as for the cases reported in our manuscript for 
larger densities, roughly 0.5%.

We have included these results, adding a small paragraph before Eq. (20). 

We hope these changes abide to the referee's original intentions and that the 
included paragraph yields a clarification of the computational approach and the 
reliabilty of our results.

Yours sincerely,
the authors.
