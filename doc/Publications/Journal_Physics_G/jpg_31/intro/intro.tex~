\section{Challenges for the Nuclear Many-Body Problem} 

Physical properties, such as masses and life-times,
of very short-lived, and hence very rare, nuclei are important
ingredients that determine element production mechanisms in
the universe. Given that present and proposed nuclear structure research facilities
will open significant
territory into regions of medium-mass and heavier nuclei,
it becomes important to investigate theoretical methods that will allow
for a description of medium-mass systems that are involved in such
element production. Such systems pose significant
challenges to existing nuclear structure models, especially since many of
these nuclei will be unstable and short-lived. How to deal with weakly
bound systems and coupling to resonant states is an unsettled problem in
nuclear spectroscopy. Similarly,  a description of  larger nuclei using a
fully microscopic first principles ("ab initio") approach, starting from the
fundamental laws of quantum theory is another unresolved problem
in nuclear physics that awaits a satisfactory, computationally tractable,
solution.

The aim of this meeting and its pertinent Institute of Nuclear 
Theory workshop for the fall of 2004, is to shed light  
on such challenges and particularly 
on several open questions facing the 
nuclear few- and many-body problems. In particular, in order to spark off possible 
new directions of research, we have singled out five major topics we feel encompass
several of the open problems in nuclear many-body theory. The program of this meeting 
reflects hopefully these choices, listed in the following subsection.

\subsection{From Free Interactions to Few- and Many-Body Systems}  

The connection between the so-called free two-body and three-body interactions
derived from effective field theory and their applications in few and many-body systems.
This is still an open and unsettled problem in nuclear physics and is crucial to the 
dialectics of all ``ab initio'' methods, which start 
typically with a two-body interaction and eventual three-body interaction 
fitted to reproduce low-energy scattering data and properties
of selected light nuclei. The contributions from Machleidt, van Kolck, Hammer,
Nogga and Phillips deal with many of these issues.  
How a two-body and/or three-body interaction evolves in a many-body medium is an 
open problem in nuclear physics since e.g., a two-body interaction fitted to reproduce
phase shifts introduces an off-shell dependence in the medium.

\subsection{'Ab Initio' Many-Body Methods}

Identify methods which can complement the shell model for heavier systems and
preserve an 'ab initio' philosophy. Presently, the Green's function Monte Carlo
\cite{bobsteve1,bobsteve2} and the No-Core shell-model \cite{bruce1,bruce2,bruce3}
approaches offer very precise few and many-body calculations of systems with 
$A\le 16$.   The Coupled Cluster approaches, inspired from the success in 
quantum chemistry, have shown a potential for performing similar calculations
for nuclei with $A\le 16$ and $A> 16$, see for example Refs.~\cite{cc1,cc2}.
Other methods based on Green's function approaches and 
Block-Horowitz are interesting candidates for 'ab initio' studies, see the 
contributions of Barbieri \cite{carlo} and Luu \cite{tom}.

\subsection{Methods for Unstable Systems} 

Identify and investigate methods that will extend to unstable systems, where
especially we face the problem of an increasing single-particle level density and 
likely resonant states.
Presently, there are several attempts at  combining shell-model 
technologies with  studies of weakly bound systems. One of the promising approaches is 
the so-called Gamow shell model, see for example Refs.~\cite{witek,roberto,hagen}, 
based on 
complex scaling techniques developed in quantum chemistry and atomic physics 
\cite{nimrod}.


\subsection{Shell Model and Effective Interactions} 

For heavier systems, one will most likely need to 
complement the shell model with methods which allow for precise derivations of effective
interactions including both two-body and three-body effective interactions.
Presently, the  shell model with effective two-body interactions based on e.g., 
perturbative many-body methods,
offers a very good description of the excited spectra of several nuclei, see for example
the cntribution of Brown in this volume.
However, this approach fails in reproducing 
binding energies, single-particle energies and basically  
all known shell closures. Recent Green's function Monte Carlo and No-Core shell-model 
calculations demonstrate the need of three-body interactions.  But for heavier nuclei
such calculations are not feasible due to the large dimensionalities involved.
One needs therefore 
in parallel more phenomenoligically based effective interactions. These 
play a crucial role
since, being fitted to reproduce the available body of data, 
they may be of great help in clarifying
which matrix elements are of importance for shell closures and other features of 
excited states.   The talks by Brown and Otsuka demonstrate the latter, 
see also Ref.~\cite{taka}. 
Another interesting topic is how to match the above 'ab initio' methods with extensions
of density functional theories, as discussed by Furnstahl and Bender.

\subsection{Computational and Algorithmic Issues}

Single out important computational and algorithmic developements. The 
factorization scheme developed by Papenbrock and co-workers is one such 
candidate
which offers a reduction by more than an order of magnitude in dimensionality 
for shell-model studies. Similarly, the Coupled Cluster approaches
allow one to study ground- and excited-state properties of nuclei
with dimensionalities beyond the capability of present shell-model
approaches, with a much smaller numerical effort when compared to
the more traditional shell-model methods aimed at similar accuracies.
Furthermore, we feel it is important to stress recent advances in computational
science.
Parallel technology offers for example a totally new paradigm
for many-body theories. It is imperative therefore to develop methods which are capable
of utilizing these advances fully.  



In the next section we wish to link the above with present and future challenges
from experiments, in order to emphasize our requirements to many-body theories
in nuclear physics.

\section{Experimental Challenges and Many-Body Methods} 

Twelve years ago two of us (BRB and JVP) organized a similar three-month workshop
at the INT in Seattle. Back in 1992 we were not in a situation where one could perform
almost exact calculations of nuclear systems.
At the time writing, we feel that nuclear many-body theory is now in the position
where precise and benchmark calculations can be performed with a given
two-body and/or three-body Hamiltonian. 
For mass $A\le 16$, the Green's function Monte Carlo
approach, the No-Core shell model and recently the Coupled Cluster approaches,
represent in principle 'ab initio' methods. This offers wide perspectives for studies
of various Hamiltonians used in  solving the non-relativistic Schr\"odinger
equation. An eventual disagreement with data can then be retraced to our Hamiltonian.
The calculations with three-body interactions of Refs.~\cite{bobsteve1,erichpetr}
clearly demonstrate this point. Unless a three-body interaction is included, one 
cannot  reproduce the binding energy or some excited states for nuclei with 
$A\le 16$. 


For stable nuclei, important for the $s$-process and Big Bang nucleosynthesis,
we have typically proton and
neutron separation energies $S_p$ and $S_n$ of the  order of $S_p\sim S_n sim 8$ MeV,
and the excited states are dominated by an interplay between collective and 
single-particle  degrees of freedom. 
However, for stable nuclei with $A > 16$, we are not able to describe
properties such as shell closures or the binding energy based on a microscopic appproach,
unless we employ a fitted two-body interaction in shell-model studies. 
Well-known cases are the shell-closures in $^{48}$Ca or the chain of oxygen isotopes,
see Brown's contribution in this volume.
We may however be able
to reproduce several excited states of stable nuclei starting from a perturbative 
many-body approach, see for example Refs.~\cite{mhj95,dean2004}. 
It is on the other hand difficult to extend such approaches in 
order to include three-body interactions or go 
beyond a certain order in perturbation theory. 
This poses serious challenges to nuclear many-body theories when we move to proton-rich
or neutron rich nuclei. Such nuclei have been produced recently 
or will be studied in the near future. As an example, neutron-rich nuclei, with 
$S_p\sim 15$ MeV and $S_n\sim 0$ MeV and crucial for the $r$-process, supernovae and 
star formation, have been studied extensively in the last years. They exhibit features 
like halos and resonances which put a strong pressure on existing   
many-body techniques. How to deal with weakly bound states and an increased number of 
single-particle degrees of freedom is not easy to account for in present shell-model 
approaches. Other features like the predictions of new shell-closures and their origin
are also properties we would expect a many-body approach to deal with. 

Summarizing, it is our firm belief that new developments in many-body theories
for nuclear problems should contain as many as possible of the following ingredients
\begin{itemize}
\item
It should be fully microscopic and start with present two- and three-body
interactions derived from e.g., effective field theory.
\item Can be improved upon systematically, e.g., by inclusion of
three-body interactions and more complicated correlations.
\item Allows for description of both closed-shell systems and valence systems.
\item For nuclear systems where shell-model studies are the only feasible ones,
viz., a small model space requiring an effective interaction, one should be able to
derive  effective two and three-body equations and interactions for the shell
model.
\item Amenable to parallel computing
\item Can be used to generate excited spectra for nuclei like 
where many shells are involved. It is hard for the traditional shell model
to go beyond one major shell.
The inclusion of several shells may imply the need of  complex effective interactions
needed in studies of weakly bound systems.
\item Finally, nuclear structure results should be used in marrying microscopic 
many-body results with 
reaction studies. A very promising method in this direction is the Lorentz transformation
method developed by Barnea, Efros, Leidemann and Orlandini, see Ref.~\cite{giusi}.
