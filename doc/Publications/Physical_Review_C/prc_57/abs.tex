\begin{abstract}

We consider $^1S_0$ pairing in infinite neutron matter 
and nuclear matter 
and show that in the lowest order approximation, where the pairing 
interaction is taken to be the bare nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction 
in the $^1S_0$ channel, the pairing interaction and the energy gap 
can be determined directly from the $^1S_0$ phase shifts.  
This is due to the almost separable 
character of the nucleon-nucleon interaction in this partial wave. 
Since the most recent NN interactions are charge-dependent, we 
have to solve coupled gap equations for proton-proton, neutron-neutron, 
and neutron-proton pairing in nuclear matter.  The results are, 
however, found to be close to those obtained with charge-independent 
potentials.
