Dear friends,

Unfortunately, we got one of those referees which do not like statistical
spectroscopy (I wonder if it is the same referee as for the Si-paper).
Anyway, please tell me your opinion about the further proceedings.

Best regards Andreas

Report of the Referee -- CBR900/Schiller
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Gamma spectra from (3He,alpha gamma) and (3He,3He'gamma) reactions
      with Fe and Mo targets were measured with a NaI detector array.
      Nuclear level densities and gamma ray transmission coefficients
      were deduced. This method is useful for heavy nuclei where
      detailed spectroscopic information cannot obtained due to too high
      level density. The method is not meaningful for light nuclei and
      nuclei close to closed shells where detailed information is
      available and statistical assumptions such as the Brink-Axel
      hypothesis or average transition rates or statistical population
      of levels are not justified. The authors should have looked at
      Firestones's Table of Isotopes and they would have found most of
      the information on 56,57Fe and 96,97Mo there without any
      additional measurement and much more precise and detailed. The
      referee plotted the cumulative number of levels in a
      semilogarithmic scale and some steps are visible. But is this
      sufficiently significant for a statistical interpretation if only
      a total of 40 levels is existent? Structural steps in the nuclear
      level sequence are well known and nothing is new.
      The authors should apply their method only to heavy nuclei not
      close to closed shells or use multi Ge arrays. The publication is
      not supported.

Subject: Re: [Fwd: Your_manuscript CBR900 Schiller]

Dear All:

Re the refereee's comments...I believe that he is half right and half
wrong...the issue is how to proceed...

The referee says that one should not (can not) apply this approach
utilizing statistical concepts for low density systems.  That the
Axel-Brinl hypothesis does not work in this case, etc...

It seems to me that one can invert this logic.  If this approach works
for example very well in Si28 where one has a limited number of states and
knows all about them, this must imply that the AB hypothesis in fact works
surprisely well even for such a case.  For the referee to state
categorically that the AB hypothesis doesn't work in this case, just
because it plausibly might not work under these circumstances, is not a
professional evaluation.  So in the extreme approach one could justify the
experiment as a test of the AB and related hypotheses...I think that the
referee has just mindlessly rejected this sort of approach without good
evidence.

On the other hand I have always been concerned over the focus on the
anomalies in the level density (For lighter nuclides).  We interpret the
plateaus as significant and indicating pair breaking but ignore other
equally strong or stronger effects in the data.  With limited numbers of
states one expects to observe some step like structures and so the whole
identification is suspect.  The fact that structures are observed at
approximately the right place and that the models qualitatively predict
the observed behavior is encouraging, but only qualitatively.  Therefore I
believe that the focus on step structure only leads to troubles.

My real concern is whether we believe in the gamma ray strength functions
for Fe and Mo.  If we do then we have interesting results and should
proceed ahead agressively...but it may be best to repackage the contents
and to refocus on different aspects of the data.

We need a discussion about the possible options.  Fighting with this
particular referee is probably impssible -- he/she is too opinionated.  We
could demand a different referee, but without a change of focus the
results will likely be the same.  

Cheers,

Gary Mitchell

Dear all of you,
I need to let out some frustrations about the FeMo referee,
before I go to bed:

1. I wonder if the referee looked into Firestones himselves.
Complete spectroscopy is known only up to E=3-4 MeV: The
level densities obtained from Firestones are shown in the attached
ps-file for some neighbouring nuclei. The straight line indicates
how it would look like if all levels were known. Big Ge-balls will never
be able to measure 10.000 levels/MeV at 8-10 MeV in molybdemum.
(I can provide such plots for our FeMo nuclei, if necessary).

2. We do not show accumulated level densities.

3. We have proved that the method works for 27,28Si

I agree with Gary that this referee will be difficult to
argue with.

Best regards
Magne
