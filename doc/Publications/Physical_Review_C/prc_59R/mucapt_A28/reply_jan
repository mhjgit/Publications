Dear Jouni and Teemu,
I added some prose to the text which Jouni sent me.
I have two questions before you send it to PRC (a little bit of patience)

1) the results of Brudanin at el which Jouni sent me are just
magnificent!!! Should we say soemthing about that to the referee and add
some more prose? That paper is a real smasher and I have a new suggestion
for  a calculation which I believe would please the experimentalists?
Can we do mu-capt on Ne to the 1+ state of 20F as they state at the end
of section 4?????  This seems to be of great interest, and there my dear
friends the spectroscopy is much better that this tricky Al nucleus.
It will not cost me much to generate operators for 20 Ne. I just need
the Q-value.

2) have you added already the paragraph Jouni mentioned? see the answer
to the ref below.

let me know what you think, i got excited by the brudanin paper.
ciao,
morten

Reply to the Referee:

The only way by which we can show that the CD-bonn interaction
(or any other effective interaction derived from many-body techniques)
might be a reasonable interaction for the RENORMALIZATION
is to study transition densities and transition matrix
elements in the valence space and compare these with
those the USD interaction. This comparison has been done below
for the E2, M1 and GT(+) operators using unrenormalized 
values for the one-body transition operators. 
We have to stress that for the renormalization we 
always need the transition matrix elements leading 
outside the valence space and to test that is very
hard and cannot be done against the USD interaction
since the latter is an effective interaction determined
for the $sd$-shell only and fitted so to reproduce 
the expt spectra.
Based on this, 
we agree with you in the point that it is hard to
demonstrate the universality of our procedure.
However, our results, and the results listed below as well, support
the conclusion that the various interactions yield similar
transition densities and matrix elements.
For the CD-bonn, Nijemegen and USD interactions we obtain very similar
results for gp/ga either with unrenormalized or normalized effective
operators. This makes us feel that the quality 
and the trend of the wave functions
is similar for all interactions and thereby that the
effect of the renormalization should be similar for the 
three interactions involved. At present, since one cannot calculate
the renormalized effective operators for the USD interaction in the same
fashion as is done for the Nijmegen or CD-Bonn interaction,
we believe that the final result for gp/ga lends support
to our conclusions. The results, although with unrenormalized
effective operators, for M1, E2 and GT transitions discussed below
support in our opinion such a conclusion.
 and
In summary,
we can only say that it seems that consistently the
renormalization with CD-Bonn or with the Nijmegen
nucleon-nucleon interactions  leads 
to a bigger value of x than without the
renormalization and that the trend with the USD interaction is
the same. 
In other words, the same happens when we 
consider the pairs 1) CD-Bonn renormalized with CD-Bonn,
2) Nijmegen renormalized with Nijmegen, 3) USD renormalized
with CD-Bonn, 4) USD renormalized with Nijmegen. 

We have added a paragraph in the manuscript which states 
this.

Here we examine in addition the goodness of the CD-Bonn matrix 
elements in terms of the reduced M1, E2 and
Gamow-Teller matrix elements and one-body
transition densities (OBTD). We show below the
comparison between the USD and CD-Bonn
calculations. OBTDs are for 28Si(g.s.) ->
28Al(1^+_3) transition and the other numbers are
M1, E2 transitions for 1+_(1,2,3) -> 2+_1 in 28Al
and GT transitions for 1+_(1,2,3) -> 0+_g.s. in 28Si.
