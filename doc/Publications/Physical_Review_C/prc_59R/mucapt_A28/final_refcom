Reply to the Referee:

We have made one further correction to the CD-Bonn interaction:
the experimental single-particle energies have now
been replaced by the ones obtained from the Zuker scheme. This
improves the spectrocopy (see the updated figures).

The only way by which we can show that the CD-bonn interaction
(or any other effective interaction derived from many-body techniques)
might be a reasonable interaction for the RENORMALIZATION
is to study transition densities and transition matrix
elements in the valence space and compare these with
those the USD interaction. This comparison has been done below
for the E2, M1 and GT(+) operators using unrenormalized
values for the one-body transition operators.
We have to stress that for the renormalization we
always need the transition matrix elements leading
outside the valence space and to test that is very
hard and cannot be done against the USD interaction
since the latter is an effective interaction determined
for the $sd$-shell only and fitted so to reproduce the expt spectra.
Based on this, we agree with you in the point that it is hard to
demonstrate the universality of our procedure.
However, our results, and the results listed below as well, support
the conclusion that the various interactions yield similar
transition densities and matrix elements.
For the CD-bonn, Nijemegen and USD interactions we obtain very similar
results for gp/ga either with unrenormalized or normalized effective
operators. This makes us feel that the quality
and the trend of the wave functions
is similar for all interactions and thereby that the
effect of the renormalization should be similar for the
three interactions involved. At present, since one cannot calculate
the renormalized effective operators for the USD interaction in the same
fashion as is done for the Nijmegen or CD-Bonn interaction,
we believe that the final result for gp/ga lends support
to our conclusions. The results, although with unrenormalized
effective operators, for M1, E2 and GT transitions discussed below
support, in our opinion, such a conclusion.

In summary,
we can only say that it seems that consistently the
renormalization with CD-Bonn or with the Nijmegen
nucleon-nucleon interactions  leads
to a bigger value of x than without the
renormalization and that the trend with the USD interaction is
the same. In other words, the same happens when we
consider the pairs 1) CD-Bonn renormalized with CD-Bonn,
2) Nijmegen renormalized with Nijmegen, 3) USD renormalized
with CD-Bonn, 4) USD renormalized with Nijmegen.

We have added a paragraph in the manuscript which states
this. ************** Not yet added ******************

Here we examine in addition the goodness of the CD-Bonn matrix
elements in terms of the reduced M1, E2 and
Gamow-Teller matrix elements and one-body
transition densities (OBTD). We show below the
comparison between the USD and CD-Bonn
calculations. OBTDs are for 28Si(g.s.) ->
28Al(1+_3) transition and the other numbers are
M1, E2 transitions for 1+_(1,2,3) -> 2+_1 in 28Al
and GT transitions for 28Si(0+gs) -> 28Al[1+_(1,2,3)].
