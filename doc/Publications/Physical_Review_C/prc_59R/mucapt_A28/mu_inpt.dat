Hi Teemu, 
the routine you sent is different from the one i have.
Thus, in the input files you will send me I will also need the values
of Ji and Jf

Could you then modify the files you will send so as to read ji and jf
together with q, iz, and ia, that is

98.0 14 28  ji jf
0 0  0 2
0 0  0 1
1 0  0 1
1 2  0 1
0 0  1 2
0 0 -1 2
0 0  1 1
0 0 -1 1
1 0 -1 1
1 2  1 1
* * ** *   
0 1  0 4 
1 1  0 4
1 1  0 3



I will read them in as well and add the triangular relations.

I guess from your table 8 that Ji=0 and jf =1 in si 28 ???
