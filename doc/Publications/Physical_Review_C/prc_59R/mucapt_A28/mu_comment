Dear Jouni,

Congratulations with nice results obtained by
you for the interpretation of the 28Si correlation
experiments data.

The effective transition operators work very well
for $x$.  Unfortunately, the paper gives no detail
description about the construction of the effective
operators.  If you will make the paper which will
contain more information please send it us.  May be
we will try to use similar procedure for our radiative
muon capture calculations.  We believe that it is
the movement in right direction to use the transition
operators coordinated with the used shell model
space.

I would like to ask you two questions to check my
understanding of your paper.
1. May I conclude that 10% variations in the muon
   capture transition operators produce very strong
   effect for the values of $x$?
2. May I conclude from Fig. 1 that the partial muon
   capture rate calculated with CDB interaction is
   almost four time smaller than the capture rate
   calculated with USD interaction?

Thank you for advance.
Cheers,
                             Volodya
