Reply to the Referee:

The only way by which we can show that CD-bonn might
be a reasonable interaction for the RENORMALIZATION
is to study transition densities and transition matrix
elements in the valence space and compare those with
the USD interaction. This comparison has been done below.
We have to stress that for the renormalization we 
always need the transition matrix elements leading 
outside the valence space and to test that is very
hard (and cannot be done against the USD interaction).
We agree with you in the point that it is hard to
demonstare the universality of our procedure and
we can only say that it seems that consistently the
renormalization with CD-Bonn or with the Nijmegen
potential leads to a bigger value of x than without the
renormalization. In other words, the same happens when we 
consider the pairs 1) CD-Bonn renormalized with CD-Bonn,
2) Nijmegen renormalized with Nijmegen, 3) USD renormalized
with CD-Bonn, 4) USD renormalized with Nijmegen. 

MORTEN: It occurred to me that we could state all these
four combinations explicitly in the text to convince the
referee that we really have taken his point and we are
just expecting some universality on basis of the used
combinations of interactions. For the referee we then
write: To take into account your valid observation about
the possible conflict between the interaction of the
valence space and the interaction used for renormalization
we have added a separate paragraph into the 
revised version of the manuscript on page .... where we 
explicitly list the four combinations used and discuss them
only hinting to a possible universality of the qualitative
features of the renormalization.


Here we examine the goodness of the CD-Bonn matrix 
elements in terms of the reduced M1, E2 and
Gamow-Teller matrix elements and one-body
transition densities (OBTD). We show below the
comparison between the USD and CD-Bonn
calculations. OBTDs are for 28Si(g.s.) ->
28Al(1^+_3) transition and the other numbers are
M1, E2 transitions for 1+_(1,2,3) -> 2+_1 in 28Al
and GT transitions for 1+_(1,2,3) -> 0+_g.s. in 28Si.
