Towards the solution of the $C sub P_/$C sub A_ anomaly in shell-model calcula
Siiskonen,T./Suhonen,J./Hjorth-Jensen,M./




        Dear Dr. Siiskonen:

              The above manuscript has been reviewed by our
        referee(s). A critique drawn from the report(s) is
        enclosed. On this basis, we judge that while the work
        probably warrants publication in some form, it does not
        meet the special criteria of importance and broad interest
        required for Physical Review Letters. In accordance with
        our standard practice (see enclosed memo), this concludes
        our review of your manuscript.

              The paper, with revision as appropriate, might be
        suitable for publication in Physical Review (BELL). If you
        submit the paper to Physical Review, the editors of that
        journal will make the decision on publication of the
        paper, and may seek further review; however, our complete
        file will be available.

              If you submit this manuscript or a revision of it to
        Physical Review (BELL), be sure to respond to all referee
        comments and cite the code number assigned to the paper to
        facilitate transfer of the records.

                                   Sincerely yours,

                                   Christopher Wesselborg
                                   Assistant Editor

Second Report of Referee A


"Several useful comments" resulted in the use of a very different
hamiltonian and the discovery of an error in the effective operator
calculations. At the very least it is quite difficult in such
cases to keep the refereeing comments to two rounds.

1) I agree that the use of the Zuker monopole corrections should result
in improved wave functions. However, relative to the many comparisons in
the literature which have been made with the USD interaction, one is in
the dark as to exactly how good the monopole corrected Bonn interaction
is, except for a few rather contradictory comments made in the paper. At
the very least one would like to see the 1+ spectrum and its comparison
to pp' and ee' data (a comparison of which indicates the configuration
mixing dependence on the spin and orbital parts). If the authors wish to
use the monopole corrected Bonn, I suggest expanding the paper to a
regular PRC article and showing more of the relevant results.

2) The USD ground state of 28Si has only about 20% (d5/2)**12.

3) The empirical GT type matrix element is reduce by 25% from its bare
value. As Towner and Arima have shown, this comes about by tensor
correlations going up to 10 hw in the excitation energy of intermediate
states. Delta admixtures may also be important. So I am not convinced
that a calculation which only gives a 10% reduction for this reduction
is adequate. One would have to argue that corrections for the other
matrix elements needed to get x are not as sensitive as the GT type.

4) Unfortunately I don't understand the arguments given as to why
x is reduced and is "more reliable".

5) At the end the conclusion that the effective transition operators
give a Cp/Ca range 3.4 to 4.7 which is in better agreement with PCAC
value of 6.8 is not very strong.

Second Report of Referee B


Manuscript Number:  LT6729
Author:  Siiskonen, Suhonen, and Hjorth-Jensen
Title:  Towards the solution of the CP/CA anomaly in shell-model ...

                   Referee's Report

A couple of minor comments:

  1.  In their conclusions on page 8, the authors write "The renormalized
result is 3.4 lte CP/CA lte 4.7, close to the PCAC value and the results of
the calculations reviewed in [12] and [10]."
      While the renormalized result is certainly closer than the bare result
to PCAC, I would not go so far as to say the range 3.4 to 4.7 is close to
the PCAC value of 6.8.
      Further I see no merit in concluding than the present result is close
to the results in ref. [10] and [12].  The latter two references use very
crude wavefunctions indeed, not complete sd-shell wavefunctions, which
are a minimum requirement for a realistic calculation these days.

  2.  On page 6, the symbol CV/CA is used twice incorrectly; it should
read CA/CV.

Referee C


Report on "Towards the solution of the Cp/Ca anomaly..." by Siiskonen,
Suhonen and Hjorth-Jensen (LT6729)

The authors aim at explaining the wellknown Cp/Ca anomaly by
renormalization of the transition operators. As a tool they use the
interacting shell model. In order to demonstrate their claims they
calculate a certain transition in muon capture on 28Si, employing interactions
whose quality are yet undemonstrated. Thus the obtained results might
just been accidental.

The suggestions (and the criticism) worded by referee A sounds very
reasonable to me. The authors should enlarge the paper by including
spectra and other transitions calculated with their interactions. Then
the reader might have a fair chance to estimate the value of the current
study. As I do not think that the paper is of the necessary urgency or
"interest to the general audience", as required for PRL, the authors
might want to submit a longer version for publication in PRC.

Two minor comments.
On page 6 the authors state: "using the renormalized
axial vector coupling may lead to double counting". Is this not
something to worry about? What are the results if the bare value for the
coupling constant is used?

On page 7 the authors discuss that the  1_3 state in
28Al has a different structure for the two interactions. This suggests
that there might be other differences in the spectra calculated for the
two interactions. Therefore it is indispensable that the authors enlarge
the paper and provide more informations before the manuscript is suited
for publication.



                                                               pr_or_prl.asc
                                                                        8/94

                PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS OR PHYSICAL REVIEW?

     The  Physical  Review publishes Articles, Rapid  Communications,  Brief
Reports,  and  Comments.  Except for Articles, these are limited in  length.
Each  paper  must have an abstract.  Announcements of planned  research  and
progress reports are not suitable for publication.  A series of short papers
by  the same authors on a particular subject is discouraged; a comprehensive
single regular article is preferred.

     If  a  paper is more suitable (see below) for the Physical Review  than
for  Physical Review Letters, it is in the author's interest to transfer the
paper  as  soon as possible.  Since many of the reasons for not accepting  a
submission   for  a  Letter  may  also   apply  to  acceptance  as  a  Rapid
Communication,  authors  should give careful consideration to submission  to
Physical Review as an Article or as a Brief Report.

     We  encourage authors to follow a Rapid Communication or a Letter  with
the  subsequent  submission  of  a  longer version of  the  same  work,  but
significant  additional  material  must be included.  Neither  Articles  nor
Brief Reports should be followed by such expanded articles.

                                  ARTICLES

     Articles  in  the  Physical Review may be short; there  is  no  minimum
length limit.

                            RAPID COMMUNICATIONS

     Rapid  Communications  are  intended for important  new  results  which
deserve  accelerated  publication,  and  are  therefore  given  priority  in
editorial processing and production to minimize the time between receipt and
publication.   Authors  submitting  papers as  Rapid  Communications  should
explain  in  a cover letter why the work justifies this priority  treatment.
Rapid  Communications  are similar to Letters; the principal  difference  is
that  Letters are of broad interest and are accessible to a general audience
of  physicists  and  allied  scientists,   while  Rapid  Communications  are
primarily for a more specialized audience, the usual readers of a particular
Physical Review journal (A, B, C, D, or E).

                               BRIEF REPORTS

     Brief  Reports are accounts of completed research which do not  warrant
regular  Articles  or the priority handling given to  Rapid  Communications;
however,  the  same  standards of scientific quality  apply.   (Addenda  are
included in Brief Reports.)

                    PHYSICAL REVIEW RECEIVED DATE POLICY

     Papers  transferred  from  Physical Review Letters  or  other  Physical
Review  journals  which  are  accepted without further review  (and  if  the
authors  have  not  caused undue delays) will retain the  original  received
date.   In  all  other  cases  a new received date, which  is  the  date  of
transfer, will be given.  However, the authors may request that the original
received date be retained.

                                                            REVISED 6/95

                 Physical Review Letters Resubmittal Policy

        It is the intent of the resubmittal policy to reduce, insofar
as possible, the time between initial submittal and a final editorial
decision; iterative improvement of a manuscript through extended
anonymous review is felt to be inappropriate.  Thus, we make every
effort to conclude the anonymous review process with a firm editorial
decision no later than at the end of the second round of anonymous
referee evaluation.  This decision can be to publish the paper in its
current form, publish after the authors have considered some optional
referee suggestions, or to publish provided specific changes are made;
otherwise, the decision is to reject the manuscript.

        The following is a scenario of a manuscript receiving negative
decisions, as affected by our policy.  We do not discuss here favorable
decisions or special cases.

        If the author responds to the first round of referee reports,
further referee evaluation may take place.  The editor will inform the
authors of a decision against publication as soon as possible.  If at
this point the author feels there is sufficient cause for an extra
degree of consideration and resubmits the manuscript, this is considered
to be a formal appeal.  The editor will consult a Divisional Associate
Editor (DAE), that is, a member of the PRL Editorial Board.

        The appeal process differs from the anonymous referee process.
The DAE recommendation is based upon the complete editorial file (all
editorial decisions including referee identity and qualifications) as
well as the scientific content of the manuscript.  The DAE may act as
``super'' referee and evaluate the manuscript as a specialist or may seek
further anonymous referee evaluation.  In most cases, there already will
be sufficient material in the file for the DAE to offer an informed
recommendation.

        The author of a paper which has been rejected subsequent to an
appeal to a DAE may appeal to the Editor-in-Chief of the American
Physical Society.  This request should be addressed to the Chair of
Divisional Associate Editors, who will forward the entire file to the
Editor-in-Chief.  Such an appeal must be based on the fairness of the
procedures followed, and must not be a request for another scientific
review.  The question to be answered in this review is:  Did the paper
receive a fair hearing?  The decision of the Editor-in-Chief concludes
the consideration of the manuscript by the American Physical Society.
