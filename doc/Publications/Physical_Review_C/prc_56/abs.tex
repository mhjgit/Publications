The coherence length of superfluid neutron matter 
is calculated  from the microscopic BCS wavefunction of a Cooper  
pair in momentum space making use of recent nucleon-nucleon
potential models and including polarization (RPA) effects. 
We find as our main result that the coherence length is proportional to 
the Fermi momentum-to pairing gap ratio, in good agreement with 
simple  estimates used in the literature, with a nearly 
interaction independent constant of proportionality. 
Our calculations can be applied to  the problem of inhomogeneous superfluidity 
of hadronic matter in the crust of a neutron star.
