Shell model studies of the proton drip line nucleus $"" sup 106 _Sb 
Engeland,T./Hjorth-Jensen,M./Osnes,E./

        Dear Dr. Hjorth-Jensen:

              The above manuscript has been reviewed by one of our
        referees.  Comments from the report are enclosed.


              These comments suggest that considerable revision of
        your paper may be in order.  If you resubmit your
        manuscript, please include a summary of the changes made,
        and a brief response to all recommendations or criticisms.

        Sincerely,

        Christopher Wesselborg
        Associate Editor
        Physical Review C

        P.S.  We regret the delay in obtaining this report.

        Referees report on the manuscript ``Shell model  ----''
        (ref. no. CFR714) by T. Engeland  et al..\\

              This paper report numerical results of shell model
        calculations of $^{106}$Sb and compared with recent
        experimental data. Because of the following reasons, I do
        not recommend to publish it in Phys. Rev. C as a rapid
        communications.

              1) The model and some results are already published
        in several papers (refs. (8), (9), (10), (15), (16)). In
        this respect, there is no urgent materials in the
        discussions of the model and effective interactions.
        However I may agree with the publication if the article
        contains some remarkable results in comparison with
        experiments. Unfortunately it is not the case in this
        article. Calculated results of energy spectra of
        $^{106}$Sb are model space dependent and have not so much
        predicting power.

              2) A new part of the study is the calculations of
        effective charges based on perturbative many-body methods.
        The authors discuss their results in comparison with
        previous theoretical studies and also with data of
        B(E2;4$^+ \rightarrow$ 2$^+ $ ) in $^{106}$Sb . They found
        that their results are substantially different from the
        previous ones, and also from experimental data. They
        should clarify more about the physics behind these
        differences including other data in A=100 region.

              3) They claim that the calculated results show a
        good agreement with experiment. I do not see any good
        agreement neither in energy spectra in Fig.1 nor the
        effective charges.



              I think that it will be suitable for a publication
        in Phys. Rev. C ,as a regular article, if the authors
        expand their study to include systematic calculations of
        energy spectra and effective charges around A=100.
        \end{document}

                 USE ELECTRONIC MODES TO SUBMIT AND RESUBMIT
                      TO THE PR/PRL COMPUSCRIPT PROGRAM

Manuscripts intended for the production compuscript-conversion program should 
be submitted and resubmitted in electronic, not paper, form.  Upload via the 
APS Web-submission site at the URL: http://publish.aps.org/ESUB/, send 
electronic mail to prXtex@aps.org (where X=a, b, c, d, e, or l for Physical 
Review A, B, C, D, E or Letters), or mail a DOS-formatted diskette.  All of 
the textual material of the paper (including tables, captions, etc.) should 
be in electronic form, as a single file. For the initial electronic-mail 
submission, use as the subject ``submit'' followed by the three-letter 
abbreviation for the name of the journal (pra, prb, prc, prd, pre, or prl) 
and the last name of the first author (for example, ``submit pra jones'' or 
``submit PRA Jones''); the first part of the message should consist of a 
filled-out submission form (the blank form is available at the above URL) or 
a submittal letter, giving the postal address of the corresponding author, 
the journal section intended, and other information.

Figures for an electronic submission must be received in at least 
review-quality form before editorial processing can begin.  Web upload or 
electronic-mail transmission (one figure per file) of PostScript-formatted 
figures will normally meet this need.  For color or continuous-tone
PostScript figures, hard-copy originals are also required.  The originals
are needed to ensure that the reproductions created from the electronic
figure files are satisfactory.  (For email transmission, use a subject 
line similar to that for the text file with the addition of the figure 
number, e.g., ``submit pra jones fig1''.)  Alternatively, you could send 
scanner-reproducible journal-quality ``originals'' immediately by overnight 
mail.  A third possibility is to send review-quality figures by fax 
(516-591-4141), while the ``originals'' are sent by conventional or overnight 
mail as soon as possible; please mark the fax transmission as being part of
an electronic-mail submission.  On resubmission, it is only necessary to 
resend your figures if the originals in our file are no longer valid.  

Paper copies of the manuscript text should not be sent as a followup unless 
the electronic-mail transmission has been unsuccessful.  

A diskette submission should be accompanied by a single paper copy of the 
manuscript, and by scanner-reproducible ``original'' figures.

Include the copyright transfer form with the original figures or forward it 
alone by conventional mail.  An electronic version of the form is available 
at the URL http://publish.aps.org/ or via ftp to aps.org in the /pub/jrnls 
directory, as the files copytrnsfr.asc, etc. (but do not return it 
electronically, as we need a handwritten signature).

It is important to confirm the accuracy of bibliographic information in 
references.  This has become more important now that the journal is online.  
Hyperlinks will be programmed to enable readers to ``click'' on references 
and jump directly to the material cited.  If your reference citations are 
incorrect or incomplete (e.g., missing author name, or an incorrect volume 
number or page), the associated hyperlinks may fail, and the usefulness of 
your paper in the online environment may be diminished.

Resubmission must be in electronic form if the paper is to remain eligible 
for the production compuscript-conversion program.  Also, macros and other 
technical problems with the file which have been pointed out by our 
compuscript staff must be eliminated by this stage if the paper is to remain 
eligible.  Resubmission forms are available at http://publish.aps.org/ESUB.  
For an email resubmission, include the filled-out form as the first part of 
the message which contains the modified manuscript; alternatively, provide 
as the first part of the message a summary of changes made and a brief 
response to all recommendations and criticisms, and also state whether or 
not the figures have been modified, and update any other relevant 
information.  Use as the subject of the message ``resub'' followed by the 
manuscript code number and the last name of the first author; for example, 
``resub AB1234 Smith'' or ``resub ab1234 smith''.

For further information about procedures for electronic submission, see the 
General Information for Contributors published in the first issue of each 
volume of the journal, and material available on APS' ftp and World Wide Web 
servers.  In particular consult the document at the URL 
ftp://aps.org/pub/jrnls/esubinform.asc or visit the Web-submission page 
http://publish.aps.org/ESUB.
