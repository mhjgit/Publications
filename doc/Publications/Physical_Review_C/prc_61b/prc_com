Dear Dr. Hjorth-Jensen:

The above manuscript has been reviewed by two of our referees.
Comments from the reports are enclosed for your consideration.

The referees have recommended that the manuscript does not merit
the priority handling of the Rapid Communications section.  A Brief
Report appears to be more appropriate provided that the remaining
issues are addressed.

When you resubmit your manuscript, please include a summary of the
changes made, and a brief response to all recommendations and
criticisms.  We regret the delay in obtaining these reports.

Yours sincerely,

Debbie Brodbar
Senior Assistant to the Editor

Second Report of the First Referee

I am afraid that the author' reply to my first report does not convince me
to recommend a publications of the article in Phys. Rev.C. , rapid
communications because of the following reasons.

1) The authors mentioned many times "good agreement" between experimental
data and the present calculations. It should be discarded from the text
because of the reason given in the first report of the referee. The authors
quote calculated results published already [ref. 7] to compare with the
present results. However, I do not see any clear improvement in the present
calculations. The authors should clarify quantitative measure to judge
``good'' or ``bad'' agreement.

2) I agree completely that the effective charges depend on the adopted
model space and also the effective interaction. It is pity that this is not
checked in $^{100}$Sn region by the present authors but the other article
[ref. 25] did it.

In conclusion, it is misleading in the present study of $^{100}$Sb to use
the word "good agreement" since neither the energy spectra in Fig. 1 nor
the calculated B(E2) value with the theoretical effective charges never
give satisfactory results in comparison with experimental data. More
elaborated shell model calculations [ref. 27] are performed recently in
$^{100}$Sn region and give consistent results between theoretical and
experimental data of B(E2) values. Thus, I do not see any reason to publish
this article as a rapid communication in Phys. Rev. C. I suggest that the
authors should modify this article in proper way and resubmit for a
publication as a regular article.

Report of the Second Referee

                   Referee's Report

Manuscript Number:  CFR714
Author:  T. Engeland, M. Hjorth-Jensen and E. Osnes
Title:  Shell model studies of the proton drip line nucleus 106Sb

I have read the manuscript together with the first referee's comments
and the authors' responses.  Here is my opinion:

First, the calculation represents a technical achievement.  The size of
the Hamiltonian matrices is huge.  Further, the calculations have been
done without any parameter having been explicitly adjusted to fit
the spectrum of 106Sb.  For these reasons, I think the manuscript
should be accepted for publication in Physical Review C.  But should it
be a Rapid Communication?  Here I agree with the first referee.  The fact
that the experimental paper was published earlier this year does not,
in itself, justify a rapid follow-up of a theory paper.  Particularly,
as the theory paper does not add to our knowledge or understanding of
106Sb.  For example, the theory paper is unable to give any insight
into whether the ground-state spin is 1+ or 2+.  With the authors'
permission, I would recommend publication as a Brief Report.

Second, on whether the calculated results show a good agreement with
experiment or not.  This is a semantic issue, not really important.
The reader can decide for himself whether the calculation is a good
fit.  To me, the fact that the spectrum is obtained without any
parameter adjustment is the impressive feature.  And seeing that
106Sb is an odd-odd nucleus, I believe the results are quite
successful.  It is perhaps disappointing for the authors that
having gone to the additional technical challenge of adding the
h11/2 orbit, no significant improvement in the spectrum was obtained.

Third, the effective charge calculation also is disappointing.  In
particular, the neutron value seems to be on the small size compared
to earlier calculations.  This suggests to me there might be some
cancellation going on between the various diagrams that might make
the results more sensitive to the calculational technique.  For
example, in the second order graphs, the intermediate-state summations
have to be truncated at some point.  Are the results sensitive
to this?

                                                               revised 7/97

                 USE ELECTRONIC MODES TO SUBMIT AND RESUBMIT
                      TO THE PR/PRL COMPUSCRIPT PROGRAM

Manuscripts intended for the production compuscript-conversion program should 
be submitted and resubmitted in electronic, not paper, form.  Upload via the 
APS Web-submission site at the URL: http://publish.aps.org/ESUB/, send 
electronic mail to prXtex@aps.org (where X=a, b, c, d, e, or l for Physical 
Review A, B, C, D, E or Letters), or mail a DOS-formatted diskette.  All of 
the textual material of the paper (including tables, captions, etc.) should 
be in electronic form, as a single file. For the initial electronic-mail 
submission, use as the subject ``submit'' followed by the three-letter 
abbreviation for the name of the journal (pra, prb, prc, prd, pre, or prl) 
and the last name of the first author (for example, ``submit pra jones'' or 
``submit PRA Jones''); the first part of the message should consist of a 
filled-out submission form (the blank form is available at the above URL) or 
a submittal letter, giving the postal address of the corresponding author, 
the journal section intended, and other information.

Figures for an electronic submission must be received in at least 
review-quality form before editorial processing can begin.  Web upload or 
electronic-mail transmission (one figure per file) of PostScript-formatted 
figures will normally meet this need.  For color or continuous-tone
PostScript figures, hard-copy originals are also required.  The originals
are needed to ensure that the reproductions created from the electronic
figure files are satisfactory.  (For email transmission, use a subject 
line similar to that for the text file with the addition of the figure 
number, e.g., ``submit pra jones fig1''.)  Alternatively, you could send 
scanner-reproducible journal-quality ``originals'' immediately by overnight 
mail.  A third possibility is to send review-quality figures by fax 
(516-591-4141), while the ``originals'' are sent by conventional or overnight 
mail as soon as possible; please mark the fax transmission as being part of
an electronic-mail submission.  On resubmission, it is only necessary to 
resend your figures if the originals in our file are no longer valid.  

Paper copies of the manuscript text should not be sent as a followup unless 
the electronic-mail transmission has been unsuccessful.  

A diskette submission should be accompanied by a single paper copy of the 
manuscript, and by scanner-reproducible ``original'' figures.

Include the copyright transfer form with the original figures or forward it 
alone by conventional mail.  An electronic version of the form is available 
at the URL http://publish.aps.org/ or via ftp to aps.org in the /pub/jrnls 
directory, as the files copytrnsfr.asc, etc. (but do not return it 
electronically, as we need a handwritten signature).

It is important to confirm the accuracy of bibliographic information in 
references.  This has become more important now that the journal is online.  
Hyperlinks will be programmed to enable readers to ``click'' on references 
and jump directly to the material cited.  If your reference citations are 
incorrect or incomplete (e.g., missing author name, or an incorrect volume 
number or page), the associated hyperlinks may fail, and the usefulness of 
your paper in the online environment may be diminished.

Resubmission must be in electronic form if the paper is to remain eligible 
for the production compuscript-conversion program.  Also, macros and other 
technical problems with the file which have been pointed out by our 
compuscript staff must be eliminated by this stage if the paper is to remain 
eligible.  Resubmission forms are available at http://publish.aps.org/ESUB.  
For an email resubmission, include the filled-out form as the first part of 
the message which contains the modified manuscript; alternatively, provide 
as the first part of the message a summary of changes made and a brief 
response to all recommendations and criticisms, and also state whether or 
not the figures have been modified, and update any other relevant 
information.  Use as the subject of the message ``resub'' followed by the 
manuscript code number and the last name of the first author; for example, 
``resub AB1234 Smith'' or ``resub ab1234 smith''.

For further information about procedures for electronic submission, see the 
General Information for Contributors published in the first issue of each 
volume of the journal, and material available on APS' ftp and World Wide Web 
servers.  In particular consult the document at the URL
