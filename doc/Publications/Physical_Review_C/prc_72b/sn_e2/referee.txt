Report of the Referee -- CER1001/Banu
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This paper reports on the relative measurement of the B(E2: 0+ " 2+1) of
the unstable, neutron deficient nucleus 108Sn using intermediate energy
Coulomb excitation (relative to that for 112Sn).

The experiment, carried out at GSI using the RISING/FRS setup appears to
have been well carried out and the analysis seems thorough. The results
are compared to the results of two large scale shell model calculations
and, although the error bars are somewhat larger than desirable, seem to
show that the B(E2: 0+1 " 2+1) value remains relatively high as the
neutron number decreases towards
50.

The physics is of shell closures in nuclei far off stability, and of
very neutron  and/or proton deficient nuclei are great current interest.
I am happy to recommend publication in Phys. Rev. when the authors have
considered the following points.

My first comments deal with the experimental part of the paper. As I
already said, the results are interesting and worth of publication.
However, if space allows, and since this is one of the early papers to
deal with this relatively new method of intermediate energy Coulomb
excitation, I would like to see some additional experimental information
provided.

1)      For example, what were the efficiencies of the various sorting
conditions? In particular, having selected the 108Sn nuclei in the FRS
what fraction of these events was also tagged by CATE?
2)      In addition, the paper says that there is a ++A1++++A5++large'
probability for a chance coincidence with bremstralung? Clearly this
depends on the counting rate in the detectors but this number is not
presented.
3)      The spectra in figure 1 still show a very large background at
energies of 1000 keV, is this background also due to chance
coincidences? Some clarification would be beneficial.
4)      What are the limitations on this technique, in terms of counting
rate (projectiles per second) and B(E2) value (if 108Sn provides a new
methodological benchmark what is the limit of that method?)

The discussion comparison with the shell model calculations was somewhat
confusing to me. The discussion on page 7 and 8, refers to calculations
using a 100Sn core, seems to imply a general seniority scheme
interpretation for the data. This discussion ends with the somewhat
tantalizing statement that ++A1++++A5++part of the systematics seems not
to follow the parabola-like trend'. The authors then appear to claim
that the data is better reproduced in calculations using a 90Zr core and
allowing for particle hole proton excitations. However, the calculations
shown in figure 4 do not seem to me to do a much better job at
reproducing the data than those in figure 2. for either heavy or light
Sn nuclei. I mention in passing that the figures in general are too
small, especially figure 4, and it is very difficult to make out the
different curves. A small increase in B(E2) value for lighter Sn nuclei
is indded shown in figure 4 but the calculations are still well below
the experimental data while overestimating the data for heavier Sn. I
would recommend that the authors revisit the discussion to try to
clarify their conclusion that the ++A1++++A5++evolution of the ESPE
govern the trend asymmetric trend' of the B(E2) values.

If these issues can be address I am happy to recommend publication in
Phys. Rev.
