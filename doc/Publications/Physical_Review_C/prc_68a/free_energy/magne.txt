Dear David,
thank you for the response to the F(E) paper. I think the replaced
paragraph you suggests makes things much more clear concerning the
links to Lee and Kosterlitz.

The free barrier DeltaF is interesting. If there were no vibrational
bands in the 0-2 MeV region, we would approximatelly see this (the
drawings looks OK with ²courier², but with e.g. ²times² the stars and
minus use different place...) :

I  ln(rho)

I                                                  *C
I                                         *
I                     B         *
I                     *
I                     *
I                     *
I                     *
A**********************-------------------------------------->E(MeV)
0                    2                               8

Here, we see the adrupt increase at 2Delta=2MeV with a temperature
from A -> B which is less than in the continues melting region B->C.
This is what we see, namely T(A,B) < T(B,C). The corresponding F-plot
with a Tc=T(A,B) will look like (not scaled correctly):

I  F
I
I                   B
I                   *
I              *    *                                  *C
I         *         *                    *
I    *              *      *
*------------------D*E--------------------------------------->E(MeV)
  0                  2                                 8

Here, DeltaF is calculated from the points just left (D) and right (E) for B.
F(D)-F(E)=E(D)-T(A,B)xS(D) ­ [E(E)-T(A,B)xS(E)]
E(D)=E(E)=2 MeV, S(D)=0 and S(E)=2x2 (2q.p. gives 2 x singel particle
entropy, see Fig.5) T(A,B)=0.45 MeV
DeltaF = 2-0.45x0-[2-0.45x4)=1.8 MeV.

The fact that DeltaF peaks experimentally at 1 MeV, and is only 30 %
of the maximum value is due to vibrational bands starting at around 1
MeV, carrying significant entropy. However, the rise of F from o to 1
MeV should point at 1.8 MeV et E=2 MeV, like this:


I  F
I

I                                                      *C
I         *  *                          *
I    *          *          *
*------------------D*E--------------------------------------->E(MeV)
  0                  2                                 8

that I indeed feel the data supports (or at least not contradicts).

I am sorry I did not understand the things with 0+, 2+, 4+ ground
band. I look on these states as still coupled Cooper-pairs, however,
with a collective rotation of the whole nucleus (Copenhagen school).
The energyspacings are so much smaller than 2*\Delta that no breaking
take place here, but I think I have misundersood something.

Also, backbending is hardly taking place in our case, because our
spin window is 0-6 hbar, and is buildt of singleparticle j's and not
much rotation. We pick up high-j neutrons below the Fermi surface
prior to thermalization and emission of gamma-rays.

Best regards
Magne
