                    REPORT OF THE REFEREE - CM7113

"Entropy in hot 161,162 Dy and 171,172 Yb nuclei"
by M. Guttormsen et. al.


The subject of the present paper is the entropy of four deformed nuclei,
with special emphasis on pairing. On the basis of experimental level
densities, the entropy of nuclei in a canonical ensemble is evaluated and
compared to calculations with a schematic pairing model.

All in all, the results are interesting and well explained, and the
results should be published. However, in my opinion, a few points must be
clarified before publication.

(I) First of all, I do not understand the discussion of the single
particle entropy, and the significance of the quantity Delta S, which
enters in the denominator of equation (18). I find the considerations
concerning scaling of the entropy with the system relevant and
interesting. However, it is not clear from the discussion of the authors,
whether the scaling refers to the canonical entropy as function of
temperature, or to the microcanonical one, which is a function of
excitation energy. It seems to me that scaling should refer to the
canonical entropy. In this perspective, figures 5 and 10 together provide
the most interesting information. Maybe the pairing model can be
exploited further in connection to figure 5, by comparing the behavior of
the entropy of the odd and even systems with some measure of pairing
correlations. In the same connection, I do not understand the discussion
of the entropy excess on the middle of page 15. It seems to me that the
value of Delta S of about 3 in the schematic model should be linked to
the number of states accessible for the one quasiparticle, scaling in
specific ways with L, N and delta. This is not so straightforward to link
to the angular momentum J in the experiment.

Coming back to Delta S and equation (18), it seems to be implied that the
odd particle can be excited independently of the excitations of the rest
of the system. This may be true for strong pairing and few quasiparticles,
but for weak pairing, this is obviously not the case.

The authors should clarify the discussion of the entropy of the
quasiparticle, on pages 12 to 17.

(II) Figure 10 shows in a convincing way that the influence of the
quasiparticle disappears with increasing temperature. Part of this is of
course built in through the back-shifted Fermi-gas. In connection to this
figure, it should be told in the paper at which temperature the
back-shifted Fermi gas becomes of dominating importance for the results.

(III) As a minor point, I find it confusing in the abstract that the
authors use the phrase that the entropy "reaches a maximum of 15 k_B
before neutron evaporation" The entropy will continue to increase beyond
the onset of neutron evaporation, but this cannot be observed with gamma
rays. I suggest to take out the words "a maximum of".

        RE:   Figure problems with manuscript: CM7113


        In reviewing the figures of your paper, we note that
        the following changes would be needed in order for your
        figures to conform to the style of the Physical Review.
        Minor changes may be made by cutting and pasting. Please
        check all figures for the following problems and make
        appropriate changes in the text of the paper itself
        wherever needed for consistency.


Fig.(s) 1
      * Use multiplication symbols (x) between numbers and powers
        of 10 not periods, centered dots, asterisks, or spaces; e.g.,
        5 x 10 (to some power).


Fig.(s) 3-6
      * Units are needed unless quantities plotted are dimensionless.
        The ideal format for units in figures is to set them in parentheses,
        following the quantity being plotted.  Alternatively the units can
        be included in the figure caption.



                                                               elec_sub.asc
                                                               revised 7/97

                 USE ELECTRONIC MODES TO SUBMIT AND RESUBMIT
                      TO THE PR/PRL COMPUSCRIPT PROGRAM

Manuscripts intended for the production compuscript-conversion program should 
be submitted and resubmitted in electronic, not paper, form.  Upload via the 
APS Web-submission site at the URL: http://publish.aps.org/ESUB/, send 
electronic mail to prXtex@aps.org (where X=a, b, c, d, e, or l for Physical 
Review A, B, C, D, E or Letters), or mail a DOS-formatted diskette.  All of 
the textual material of the paper (including tables, captions, etc.) should 
be in electronic form, as a single file. For the initial electronic-mail 
submission, use as the subject ``submit'' followed by the three-letter 
abbreviation for the name of the journal (pra, prb, prc, prd, pre, or prl) 
and the last name of the first author (for example, ``submit pra jones'' or 
``submit PRA Jones''); the first part of the message should consist of a 
filled-out submission form (the blank form is available at the above URL) or 
a submittal letter, giving the postal address of the corresponding author, 
the journal section intended, and other information.

Figures for an electronic submission must be received in at least 
review-quality form before editorial processing can begin.  Web upload or 
electronic-mail transmission (one figure per file) of PostScript-formatted 
figures will normally meet this need.  For color or continuous-tone
PostScript figures, hard-copy originals are also required.  The originals
are needed to ensure that the reproductions created from the electronic
figure files are satisfactory.  (For email transmission, use a subject 
line similar to that for the text file with the addition of the figure 
number, e.g., ``submit pra jones fig1''.)  Alternatively, you could send 
scanner-reproducible journal-quality ``originals'' immediately by overnight 
mail.  A third possibility is to send review-quality figures by fax 
(516-591-4141), while the ``originals'' are sent by conventional or overnight 
mail as soon as possible; please mark the fax transmission as being part of
an electronic-mail submission.  On resubmission, it is only necessary to 
resend your figures if the originals in our file are no longer valid.  

Paper copies of the manuscript text should not be sent as a followup unless 
the electronic-mail transmission has been unsuccessful.  

A diskette submission should be accompanied by a single paper copy of the 
manuscript, and by scanner-reproducible ``original'' figures.

Include the copyright transfer form with the original figures or forward it 
alone by conventional mail.  An electronic version of the form is available 
at the URL http://publish.aps.org/ or via ftp to aps.org in the /pub/jrnls 
directory, as the files copytrnsfr.asc, etc. (but do not return it 
electronically, as we need a handwritten signature).

It is important to confirm the accuracy of bibliographic information in 
references.  This has become more important now that the journal is online.  
Hyperlinks will be programmed to enable readers to ``click'' on references 
and jump directly to the material cited.  If your reference citations are 
incorrect or incomplete (e.g., missing author name, or an incorrect volume 
number or page), the associated hyperlinks may fail, and the usefulness of 
your paper in the online environment may be diminished.

Resubmission must be in electronic form if the paper is to remain eligible 
for the production compuscript-conversion program.  Also, macros and other 
technical problems with the file which have been pointed out by our 
compuscript staff must be eliminated by this stage if the paper is to remain 
eligible.  Resubmission forms are available at http://publish.aps.org/ESUB.  
For an email resubmission, include the filled-out form as the first part of 
the message which contains the modified manuscript; alternatively, provide 
as the first part of the message a summary of changes made and a brief 
response to all recommendations and criticisms, and also state whether or 
not the figures have been modified, and update any other relevant 
information.  Use as the subject of the message ``resub'' followed by the 
manuscript code number and the last name of the first author; for example, 
``resub AB1234 Smith'' or ``resub ab1234 smith''.

For further information about procedures for electronic submission, see the 
General Information for Contributors published in the first issue of each 
volume of the journal, and material available on APS' ftp and World Wide Web 
servers.  In particular consult the document at the URL
