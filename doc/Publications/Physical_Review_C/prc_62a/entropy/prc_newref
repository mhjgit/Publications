2nd Report of the Referee:

Referee report on the paper

"Entropy in hot 161,162 Dy and 171,172 Yb nuclei" (revised version)

by M. Guttormsen et. al.

The revision has now clarified the discussion.
Below, I suggest two minor changes.

(I) Having understood the point by the authors concerning the scaling
of the entropy, I think that the discussion on page 12 is somewhat misleading.
Below, I first presents my arguments on this point, for the authors to
consider, and then I suggest a small correction.

The odd systems are here smaller than the even systems, and eventually
at higher temperature the larger size of the even system will result in a
higher entropy, as well. Displaying the entropy as function of energy
obscures this somehow, but allows one to compare data and model without
use of the extrapolation of the level density. I feel that the particle
number differences displayed on figures 6 and 11 are more a property of the
pairing gap, related to the back-shift energy of the level density, than
it is related to the question whether the entropy is an extensive quantity.
In my view, figure 11 is more informative, together with figure 5, since
they display the transition from a quasiparticle picture, with the odd
system carrying more entropy, towards a picture with true extensive behavior,
for which the difference in the level density parameters "a" should scale with
the full nucleon number. This may be in accordance with the discussion on
page 12, where the topic of extensive behavior is introduced: The pairing
force is an effective interaction, which stretches over the whole volume,
whereas the independent particle motion associated with the underlying
levels will scale in an extensive way for a saturating system.

I suggest on page 12 to replace the sentence :
"However, if we assume that the entropy is an extensive quantity, i.e.
that it goes like $S=nS_1$ ..."

by

"However, it may be fruitful to investigate whether the entropy is
an extensive quantity with respect to the number of quasiparticles,
in which case it goes like $S=nS_1$ ..."

(II) As a minor point, I think that the words "since" and "however" should
be taken out of the sentence beginning on line 4 of page 17, and that
"in Fig 11." should be replaced by "Fig. 11" in the following
sentence.

                                                               revised 7/97

                 USE ELECTRONIC MODES TO SUBMIT AND RESUBMIT
                      TO THE PR/PRL COMPUSCRIPT PROGRAM

Manuscripts intended for the production compuscript-conversion program should 
be submitted and resubmitted in electronic, not paper, form.  Upload via the 
APS Web-submission site at the URL: http://publish.aps.org/ESUB/, send 
electronic mail to prXtex@aps.org (where X=a, b, c, d, e, or l for Physical 
Review A, B, C, D, E or Letters), or mail a DOS-formatted diskette.  All of 
the textual material of the paper (including tables, captions, etc.) should 
be in electronic form, as a single file. For the initial electronic-mail 
submission, use as the subject ``submit'' followed by the three-letter 
abbreviation for the name of the journal (pra, prb, prc, prd, pre, or prl) 
and the last name of the first author (for example, ``submit pra jones'' or 
``submit PRA Jones''); the first part of the message should consist of a 
filled-out submission form (the blank form is available at the above URL) or 
a submittal letter, giving the postal address of the corresponding author, 
the journal section intended, and other information.

Figures for an electronic submission must be received in at least 
review-quality form before editorial processing can begin.  Web upload or 
electronic-mail transmission (one figure per file) of PostScript-formatted 
figures will normally meet this need.  For color or continuous-tone
PostScript figures, hard-copy originals are also required.  The originals
are needed to ensure that the reproductions created from the electronic
figure files are satisfactory.  (For email transmission, use a subject 
line similar to that for the text file with the addition of the figure 
number, e.g., ``submit pra jones fig1''.)  Alternatively, you could send 
scanner-reproducible journal-quality ``originals'' immediately by overnight 
mail.  A third possibility is to send review-quality figures by fax 
(516-591-4141), while the ``originals'' are sent by conventional or overnight 
mail as soon as possible; please mark the fax transmission as being part of
an electronic-mail submission.  On resubmission, it is only necessary to 
resend your figures if the originals in our file are no longer valid.  

Paper copies of the manuscript text should not be sent as a followup unless 
the electronic-mail transmission has been unsuccessful.  

A diskette submission should be accompanied by a single paper copy of the 
manuscript, and by scanner-reproducible ``original'' figures.

Include the copyright transfer form with the original figures or forward it 
alone by conventional mail.  An electronic version of the form is available 
at the URL http://publish.aps.org/ or via ftp to aps.org in the /pub/jrnls 
directory, as the files copytrnsfr.asc, etc. (but do not return it 
electronically, as we need a handwritten signature).

It is important to confirm the accuracy of bibliographic information in 
references.  This has become more important now that the journal is online.  
Hyperlinks will be programmed to enable readers to ``click'' on references 
and jump directly to the material cited.  If your reference citations are 
incorrect or incomplete (e.g., missing author name, or an incorrect volume 
number or page), the associated hyperlinks may fail, and the usefulness of 
your paper in the online environment may be diminished.

Resubmission must be in electronic form if the paper is to remain eligible 
for the production compuscript-conversion program.  Also, macros and other 
technical problems with the file which have been pointed out by our 
compuscript staff must be eliminated by this stage if the paper is to remain 
eligible.  Resubmission forms are available at http://publish.aps.org/ESUB.  
For an email resubmission, include the filled-out form as the first part of 
the message which contains the modified manuscript; alternatively, provide 
as the first part of the message a summary of changes made and a brief 
response to all recommendations and criticisms, and also state whether or 
not the figures have been modified, and update any other relevant 
information.  Use as the subject of the message ``resub'' followed by the 
manuscript code number and the last name of the first author; for example, 
``resub AB1234 Smith'' or ``resub ab1234 smith''.

For further information about procedures for electronic submission, see the 
General Information for Contributors published in the first issue of each 
volume of the journal, and material available on APS' ftp and World Wide Web 
servers.  In particular consult the document at the URL
