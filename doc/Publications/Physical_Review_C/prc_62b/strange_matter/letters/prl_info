   We have successfully generated output from the manuscript file sent
by e-mail to our Editorial Office and attached the PostScript-formatted
figure(s).  The figures will be considered as originals.  There is no need
for you to send the original figure(s) by postal or overnight mail.  The
manuscript is being processed and has been assigned the accession code
number cited above.  This code number should be included in all future
correspondence.

   Once information concerning your manuscript has been put into
our database, the above code number may be used to obtain current
information regarding the status of your manuscript from the Author
Status Inquiry System (ASIS) at http://publish.aps.org/STATUS/.  Note
that depending on workloads in the office and other factors,
preliminary processing may take one to several days, so that initially
the information available via ASIS may be very incomplete (e.g., only
one or two authors, incomplete title, no address or communications
information).  In this period, please do not be concerned and do NOT
send us requests to insert the missing information.

   To avoid confusion and delay, DO NOT send further copies of the text
of the manuscript by postal or overnight mail.  If you have already
sent duplicate copies of the manuscript by either postal or overnight
mail, contact us by e-mail immediately and indicate whether such copies
should be processed instead of the file we received by e-mail.

   The publication charge requested for articles submitted electronically
to Physical Review Letters is DISCOUNTED (see the inside front cover of a 
given journal).  This is provided they are in the REVTeX or LaTeX format, 
and are printable at the Editorial Office.  Resubmission of the manuscript 
must continue to be in electronic form.

   Furthermore, a compuscript-conversion program exists for the journals.
It is designed to convert an author's REVTeX-formatted file into the
SGML (PRL) or Xyvision (PR) production file.  These production files
comprise the archival base from which the journal pages are composed and
online displays are (or will be) created.  All electronic submissions
are considered as candidates for the production compuscript-conversion
program.

   Staff at the Editorial Office will be checking whether your file
meets the eligibility requirements for the compuscript program.  If the
file is NOT eligible you will be contacted with instructions on how it
might be repaired.  Be advised that participation in the compuscript
program is independent of the discount earned above.  There is no additional
discount applied for being in the compuscript program.  Further details,
especially the eligibility requirements, exist in the file
ftp://aps.org/pub/jrnls/compu_inform_prl.asc.

     ******************************************************************
     ******************************************************************
     For your next article, consider using the web-based form for initial
     submission to the Physical Review and Physical Review Letters journals,
     now available through the URL:

                       http://publish.aps.org/ESUB/

     This form contains instructions for submitting e-prints from the
     Los Alamos or APS e-print servers, for direct upload of files, and
     a standardized ``cover letter'' for regular e-mail or hard-copy
     submissions.  A similar form for resubmission of manuscripts under
     review is being planned.

                     RESUBMISSION PROCEDURES

   When resubmitting your manuscript file in response to recommendations
and criticisms from the review process, or to present other corrections
and author revisions during the review process, the full file should be
resubmitted by e-mail. The cover letter should state the manuscript code
number, a summary of the changes made, and a statement as to whether or
not the figures have been modified.  Use as the SUBJECT of the message
"resub" followed by the manuscript code number and the last name of the
first author; e.g., "resub ab1234 Smith."  Any new or revised figures,
if not sent as postscript files, should be faxed at the same time the
manuscript file is e-mailed.  Original figures should be mailed as soon
as possible.

   Use only e-mail to send us corrected manuscripts and/or resubmittals
in response to reviews.  Sending the initial manuscript by e-mail and a
later modified version by postal or overnight mail creates the risk of
our having and using an obsolete electronic file.

   Please note that the Editorial Office cannot make content changes to
your file.  If you make a change or correction during the review process,
however minor it may be, you must e-mail the entire file to us.  This
policy ensures that your file remains as you intended it to be.

   On the other hand, the "rules" change after you receive notification
of editorial acceptance of your article.  Then, content changes need to
be explicitly described or marked, so that our production vendors can
correct the SGML (or Xyvision) archive files.

   Thank you for your cooperation.
