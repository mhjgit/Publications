Hi Martino, this is Assum.... Como estas? See you in Seattle next
september, right?... Now back to Isaac...

As you can see Assum is here (dando la barrila). Now here there are 
the instructions you must follow in order to get the matrix elements
Lambda->Lambda and Sigma- -> Sigma -.

1-. The subroutine ghypfnstrang-2 gives all the g-matrices for the
    strangeness -2 sector. If you want to print them you have to 
    activate all the write(11,any format). The file you get has
    the following aspect: (IMPORTANT: THE PROGRAM ONLY WRITE 
    DIAGONAL ELEMENTS, If you need non-diagonal I must made a
    little change in the write's)

    Number of mesh points: 
    Mesh points: there are 24 numbers     
    Number of CM and Starting Energies: 
    CM and Starting Energies
    Fixed T
    Fixed Tz
    Fixed J
    Icase 1
    Bare potential matrix elements
    G-matrix elements
    Icase 2
    Bare potential matrix elements
    G-matrix elements
    Next J
    .......... y asi at infinitum (may be less) ....

    When you run the program you this structure will be more easy
    to see. In order to explain you better the structure I will send
    you a fax of some notes I made.

 2-. In the subroutine ghypfnstrang-2., I call the bare potential
     in line: call nijpot(nymod,jc,fkmev,nk)

     where

             nymod: is a number from 1 to 6 which chooses the
                    different parametritzations of the potential
                    (i.e 1 means NSC97a, 2 means NSC97b and so on)

             jc: is the angular momentum J: from 0 to 4

             fkmev: is the array  of relative momenta

             nk: is the number of mesh points, in our case 24  
 
 
   3-. As you will see in my notes:

       wave 1S0 corresponds to J=0, icase = 1, you have
       to choose the 24 first g-matrix elements of the box labeled
       icase=1 (because S=0 and L=J) 

       on the other hand
 
       wave 3S1 corresponds to J=1, icase = 2, you have
       to choose the 24 first g-matrix elements of the box
       labelled icase=2 (because S=1 and L=J-1)

       For the Lambda_Lambda case there will be the two waves,
       but for the Sigma-_Sigma- one there will exist only 1S0, there 
       is no coupling in the 3S1 channel
    
       I hope you will not have many problems, anyway if
       you have problems, say me which matrix elements you
       really need and I could try to run the program here.

       Have a nice day.

       P.S. I cannot receive mails in gromit today because
            the system manager is making changes in it. Write
            me to my account in Oslo: isaac.vidania@fys.uio.no

Hi again Entropy-man

I've just sent to you a fax witj some notes I made
some time ago about the potential and the matrix structure
of it and of the g-matrix. Say me if you've recived them.
Artur has said me that you are agree in running again the
finite nuclei with the new nijmegen potentials.


Have a nice weekend

Hyperon man
