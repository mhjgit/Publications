Dear Morten,
The paper looks great and very clear and straightforward to read.
Congratulations. Here are a few comments:
1) In the abstract, the sentence "The hyperonn-hyperon interaction allows
for ..." might not be strictly true, because the presence of hyperons is
dictated not only by the YY interaction but also by tht YN and NN ones.
I would change this sentence and the sentence before to something like:
"It is found that the only strange baryons emerging in beta-stable matter 
up to total baryonic densities of 1.2 fm**{-3} are the Sigma^- and the
Lambda hyperons."
2) At the end of page 2, third line from the last, I would change:
 "...converse process happen,...." by "...inverse process happen."
(throwing away the rest of the sentence, since it is explained in the next
one)
3) Page 4, line 3: The sentence starting "The interactions
for the S=-2,-3..." can be omitted (I'm thinking of reducing the text a
little)
4) 5 lines after eq. (4): Replace:
"The G-matrix is solved in the relative and center-of-mass frame," by
"The G-matrix is solved using relative and center-of-mass coordinates,"
(The point is that the G-matrix is in fact solved in the Laboratory frame)
5) In eq. (6), the Real part "Re" appears funny
6) Page 5, line 5, I would change it to:
"to solve Eqs. (5) and (6) to obtain the single-particle energy of the
particles involved at the corresponding Fermi momentum."
7) In the same paragraph, 2 lines after:
Insert a comma before and after the piece "for every nucleon and hyperon
fraction"
8) First line of page 7. The sentence starting "From the bottom..." has a
question mark before From. This is a typical problem that appears when
sending the file my e-mail. It can be solved by adding, in the text file,
the symbols {} in front of the word From:
{}From
9) Page 8, line 4. I would join the sentence "This would .." with the
previous one:
"...and hyperon-hyperon interactions, which would then contradict..."
10) The last sentence contains two times the need to make the EoS stiffer.
I would cut the sentence at the end of the word "needed".
11) I guess that you already changed the label on the y-axis of fig.2 to
"densities" insetad of "fraction"
12) caption of figure 4: change "neutrons" to "neutron". Would it be
better to put "as functions of the total baryonic density n" just after
"neutron star matter"? 

Thanks again for your efforts. We are working on the other paper. The
introduction, formalism and part of the results has been written, up to
the infinite corrections that still will need to be made! 
You will hear from us soon (hopefully).
Ciao,

Angels
