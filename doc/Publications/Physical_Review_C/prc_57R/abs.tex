\begin{abstract}
After presenting solutions of the coupled, non-relativistic
 $^3S_1$-$^3D_1$ gap equations for neutron-proton pairing 
in symmetric nuclear matter, 
we proceed to estimate relativistic effects by solving the same 
gap equations modified according to minimal relativity and using 
single-particle energies from a Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculation. 
We find that the relativistic effects decrease the value of the gap 
at the saturation density $k_F=1.36\;{\rm fm}^{-1}$ considerably, 
in conformity with the lack of evidence for strong neutron-proton 
pairing in finite nuclei.
