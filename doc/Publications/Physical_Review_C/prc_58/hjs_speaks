dear oslo mafia,

how nice to have your united opinion! in fact i think we can agree now on the 
paper, because you propose exactly what i had in mind, namely to 
COMPARE the results in a fair and objective manner:
you put ALL the results in ONE table which allows an immediate comparison;
i proposed to put ALL the results in ONE figure (concerning the esthetical aspect
wait until you receive my proposal), and not in two separate
figures with different x and y scales!!
this second point was so heavily defended by oystein from the start!
in the same manner i insist, as you do, to put ALL the phaseshifts in ONE
figure, because it will allow from the start to recognize and discuss 
the benefits of the new potentials.
to put a table is also fine with me, but please in that case you should
perform all the bhf calculation (also paris and v14) in your manner,
because there seem to be some discrepancies between your and my calculations,
which could easily magnify and disturb the comparison.
concerning the numerical accuracy, i don't know wether you believe in the
3 digits you specify; i do not even believe the second one in some cases.
surely a comparison of the relative magnitudes goes allright, but the 
absolute numbers should be taken with a grain of salt.

so, please tell me wether you have still substantial objections,
i will send you the new version of the paper before the end of the week.
later today i will send you the phaseshifts for the paris and v14 to include in 
the figure.
finally, a purely technical point:

if you plot the bhf gaps on a reasonable scale they look not very smooth.
i suppose this is problem of numerics? you do not have more accurate results?
at least, could you send me results up to the gap closure (or 3.8 fm**-1)
for the cdbonn and nijmegen pots?

hei sa lenge,
             hans-josef
