dear oystein,

come va oggi? is the norwegian sun burning on your head mercilessly?
it is nice that we both agree now that you are quite stubborn!
concerning the remaining disagreements, i will propose you a compromise:

i think we agree now on the figures, excepts the arrangement of the gap results.
wether we arrange them in one plot, or individually, can be decided later.
i will send you the kind of plot i propose.
concerning the contents, i propose the following: in the plot with the free
spectrum we include results with the old potentials, using a particular
linestyle, for instance.
then one can see at first glance, wether there is a qualitative difference
or not. (if you would have done that, you would have noticed, that the 
paris and bonn-b agree with the new potentials up to kf=2.0, contrary
to what is stated in the text so far. the notable exception is the v14.)
this kind of plot can actually be used in you favour, allowing to explain
again, why the old (v14) give qualitatively different results.
for this purpose i still propose to include in fig.8 also the old phase
shift predictions, just to convince the reader that they ARE different.
in fact i still don't understand why you object this point so strongly,
since it would allow you to advance your own argument!?
otherwise i agree that results with old potentials need not be presented.
in this way we can save at least the two separate plots of the gaps with the
old potentials.

to summarize: you guys prepare (a) the combined plot of the matrix elements,
              (b) an improved plot of the phase shifts, pleeease including
              the old potentials. 
              i prepare a combined plot of the gaps in the style i propose.
              we can still convert it in your format, if you like it better.

i am afraid there are still some numbers you need to send me across europe
for this purpose, namely the gaps for
1) the bonn-b with free spectrum
2) the complete set with the cd-bonn, namely: free, BHF, eff. mass approx.,
   3p2 only.

also, i noted that the ploted gaps in figs.9 and 13 do not extend up to the
closure of the gap. you do not have the missing numbers for large kf?

there is another technical reason that i propose to leave out the
comparison of the old and new results with bhf spectrum, namely
in the meantime i also performed bhf calculations with the v18, 
and my results are quite different from yours. i get:
kf   Delta
1.2  0.019
1.4  0.097
1.6  0.214
1.8  0.266
2.0  0.287
2.2  0.235 
2.4  0.113 
these values are larger than yours
due to larger effective masses i obtain in the bhf.
so, we cannot directly compare results obtained with my and with your bhf
spectra. 

so, let me know wether you agree to the compromise i propose!

ciao ciao,
          hans-josef
