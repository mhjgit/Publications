Dear Marcello & Morten,

In comparing our numerical results for the 3P2-3F2 pairing gap with 
your recently published results (PRC 58, Oct issue), we have found 
some disturbing discrepancies that we would like to resolve.  We 
have concentrated on the Argonne v_14 and v_18 cases so those are 
the only ones involved.  Our calculation makes use of the separation 
method extended to the triplet case, as described in my talk at Trento
last year, in Vladimir's thesis (though that presentation has since 
been greatly polished), and (partially) in our recent PRL.  

The discrepancies are not huge but they are bothersome.  They affect 
both the pairing matrix elements and the angle-averaged gaps.  Some 
of the problem, but not all, is probably due to different conventions 
(thus stray constant factors like sqrt 2 and 2/pi that we still have 
to track down to our satisfaction).

First the matrix elements.  All we can compare is the diagonal m.e.s 
for v_18 (i.e. with your Fig. 3).  As closely as I can tell, the positions 
of the minima and crossover (around 1.3 and 3.2 inv fm, resp.) agree,
but the scales are different by a factor of about 1.6 (suspiciously 
close to pi/2), with our m.e.s being the LARGER ones.  Of course, a 
discrepancy like that would show up very prominently in the gap, 
so I believe that most of it must be just a constant factor that is 
absorbed somewhere else (differing conventions).

Also, the discrepancy in the the gap values works the other way 
-- our v_14 and v_18 gap values are SMALLER than yours by roughly a 
factor 1.4 (suspiciously close to sqrt 2).  But as closely as we can 
tell, it's not just a constant factor, since your gap values falling 
off more slowly than ours at the high end.  

I am working under the assumption that your results are correct and 
numerically the more accurate, since you have checked your solution 
three ways.  It would be very helpful to us in our attempt to trace 
the discrepancy if you could send us tabulated values, as functions 
of k_F, for: 

(1) The v_18 matrix elements you used.  (The diagonal 11 case shown
    in your Fig. 3 should be enough for us to determine if something
    is wrong at the level of the matrix elements.)

(2) Your angle-averaged gap, for both v_14 and v_18 cases.  (This
    may help us determine if there is a flaw in our numerics near
    k_F.)

Would this be possible?

Incidentally, we are puzzled by the presence of the factor pi/2
in your Eq. (9).  To us, this appears to be at variance with the
formulas in Takatsuka & Tamagaki and Amundsen & Ostgaard, considering
the traditional factor 1/pi in Eq. (7).  Of course, removing this
factor won't help our matrix-element discrepancy; it would just
make it worse ...

With all best wishes,

John
