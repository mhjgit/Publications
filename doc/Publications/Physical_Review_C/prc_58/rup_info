Morten,

I have looked at the phase shift predictions for 3P2 up to
Tlab = 1000 MeV for the high-precision pots.
The result is that none can get the phase shifts between 400 and 1000 MeV
right. The reason for this is that there is a cusp in the 3P2
phase shifts around 600 MeV (see e.g. Fig. 7.9 of Adv. Nucl. Phys.
19, 189 (1989), p. 277 therein). The dotted curve in that figure is
a typical potential model prediction (Bonn B in this case), while
the solid curve is from a model that includes explicit Delta isobars.
It is the threshold of the N-Delta channel that makes the cusp.
So, no way any potential model can do it.

What potential models do is typically the following:
Some have generally "high" phase shifts, best example:
Nijm-II; then the phase shifts up to 600 MeV are described well,
however, after that far too high.

Or they are not too high at 100 MeV (good example: V_18),
but then they are far too low in the 400 - 800 MeV region.

The CD-Bonn is "in the middle", because when I was fitting
the CD-Bonn , I always also had an eye on all the phase
shifts up to 1000 MeV. (As you know, we are always a little
bit smarter than the others.)

In conclusion, using the empirical phase shifts for your purpose
is probably the best, under these circumstances.

I hope this was useful information,

all the best

Rupert.
