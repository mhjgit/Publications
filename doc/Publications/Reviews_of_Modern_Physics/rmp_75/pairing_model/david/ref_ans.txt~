Dear Editors,

please find enclosed a revised version of LD 8547,
by Belic, Dean and Hjorth-Jensen.

We have also included our answers to both referees, 
indicating where changes have been made. 

Whether our arguments may or may not convince referee A,
is clearly something we cannot control. We do however believe
that referee B has coined the essence of our manuscript, and we 
are quite convinced that our paper deserves the attention of
a PRL. 

In case other referees are to be consulted, we would like to take
the liberty of proposing at least one whom we feel
may be competent:

Prof Yoram Alhassid, Yale University, e-mail: yoram.alhassid@yale.edu


Since there are no changes to the original figures, they are not included
in the revised ms. The text, as a latex file, is included in
this message after the reply to the referees.

Yours sincerely,
Morten Hjorth-Jensen

***********   Answers to the referees

We are much indebted to both referees for comments and suggestions
about our manuscript. Below we summarize our changes and include
our responses to both referees as well.

To referee B, we agree that the method of Borrmann et al, as applied
to our model, does not lead to such a as clear a conclusion as seen in
the analysis of Fig 1, where the free energy is studied. We have revised
the last part of our manuscript accordingly, following the 
pertinent suggestions of referee B.

However, although the distribution of zeros may not yield a clear
determination of the parameter alpha and thereby the order of the phase, 
we still feel that the approach
presented by Borrmann et al, reveals in a beautiful way the separation
of distinct phases, in our case 
the strongly paired one weighted by the ground state
and a phase where broken pairs co-exist with pairing correlations. 
One also notices that as the number of particles increases, the zeros
approach the real axis, an indication of behavior towards the infinite
system. 
Moreover, when the relation between the pairing strength (G) 
and the single-particle spacing (d) increases (d/G > 1.5), 
the system moves from a
strongly correlated one to a weakly correlated one. The bottom figure 
in figure 2, clearly demonstrates this feature, the distribution
of zeros does not create a clear boundary, as seen in the three upper
ones.

The latter can also be seen for all temperatures in the analysis of Fig 1.
There, for d/G > 1.5 and for all numbers of particles investigated here,
the free energy developes only one minimum, and thereby no phase transition
like behavior. 

These two different ways of studying a finite system, 
the standard thermodynamical analysis of fig 1 and 
Borrmann et al's method in fig 2, yield, 
in our point view, novel information and tools to analyze eventual 
phase transitions
in finite systems. 

Since signs of phase transitions in finite systems are elusive, one needs
to combine several methods. In the light of the latter, we would like
to comment on remarks made by referee A.

We agree that much of the information about the relation between 
the pairing strength and the single-particle spacing has already been discussed
in the literature, especially, prior to the solid state discussions after
Tinkham et al's experiments, in the nuclear physics community.
Exact solutions of the Schroedinger equation for the pairing
hamiltonian using e.g., Richardson's
method have been well-known to nuclear physicist for at least three decades.

However, we feel that our paper presents additional information on the 
analysis  of the behavior of phase transition like behaviors in finite 
systems. We'd like to reiterate some of these arguments in order to see
whether we can convice  referee A as well. 

a) The methodological part
--------------------------
   1a) Our method, which consists in using the seniority quantum number
       in a block-diagonalization of the hamiltonian, allows us to
       obtain numerically all eigenvalues and thereby determine 
       exactly the microcanonical partition function. That itself we
       believe merits an attention close to PRL. This has never been
       done before, at least to our knowledge. The approaches used in the 
       solid state community deal essentially with the ground state and
       and the first excited state, whereas we are interested, in order to
       perform a thermodynamical analysis, in all eigenstates.
       One can still, however, from studies of the ground state and the
       first excited state reveal important information about the relation
       between the sigle-particle spacing the interaction strength.

       Moreover, many of studies of such systems have been performed 
       in the canonical ensemble. This leads to our next point.

   2a) Since this is a finite system, the microcanonical ensemble 
       is the preferred one, see also the discussions in refs [10-12]. 
       We have, in addition to performing an exact diagonalization
       also performed large-scale Monte-carlo shell-model
       calculations, see e.g., ref [22] in the present manuscript,
       in the canonical ensemble. Based on these Monte-Carlo calculations
       we employed the histogram method of refs [16,17] in order to simulate
       the microcanonical ensemble. However, the fluctuations in energy
       in the canonical ensemble are so large, that we cannot see the 
       various minima of Fig 1. 
       We think this is an important message, since it indicates that
       structures seen in the microcanonical ensemble get smeared 
       out in the canonical ensemble for such a finite system,
       thereby inhibiting a clear interpretation of a phase transition.
        
       In a sense, these is disconforting since our capability to obtain
       -all- eigenvalues is limited to systems with at most 16-18 particles.   

   3a) The microcanonical partition function is then in turn used
       to compute the exact canonical partition function. 
       In this ensemble we use Borrmann et al's recent recipe to 
       study the behavior of the zeros of the partition function in the complex
       temperature plan. This method offers an alternative to the 
       microcanonical one. 
       For d/G > 1.5, we develop only one free energy minimum (not
       shown in fig 1) and have thereby no sign of a phase transition.
       We demonstrate this in the bottom panel of fig 2. 
       See also the discussion above.

b) The physics part

   1b) We would like to emphasize that what we see is not a classical
       phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. The single-particle
       occupation probability changes smoothly and there is no sudden
       change from a state which is totally paired to a normal fermi liquid.

       However, the calculations in the microcanonical ensemble reveal a much
       richer structure, a structure which cannot be seen in the canonical
       ensemble calculations. 

       What we actually see, when d/G < 1.5, is that the system can develop
       several intermediate steps where e.g., two and three broken pairs
       coexist or three and four coexist and so forth. 
       That means that as the temperature
       is increased that more and more pairs are broken, but that at 
       certain temperatures we can have intermediate phases where
       e.g., two and three pairs broken are favored. This information
       that we convey cannot be seen in the canonical ensemble.  

       Such a feature is actually seen experimentally through studies
       of level densities in finite nuclei, see e.g., Refs [9]
       and especially Guttormsen et al PRC 62 (2000) 024306. The experimental
       level density is proportional to the microcanonical partition
       function.   
       
       We believe that such a feature should apply to other physics
       systems as well, i.e., that one developes phases where 
       different seniority quantum numbers can co-exist.


   2b) The amusing feature is that a phase where e.g, two and three
       broken pairs co-exist with the same free energy minimum, 
       exhibits the same temperature, irrespective of number of particles.
       That shows to us a robust property of the method and supports
       further the possibility of interpreting this as a phase-transition
       like behavior.  We would also like to stress the fact that what
       we see is a reminiscence of the phase in the infinite system, 
       and that the transition-like behavior seemingly has a  memory of what
       happens in the infinite system.


   3b) An interesting question that we cannot answer within this
       simple pairing model, is what happens when a repulsive
       long-range force is introduced. In nuclear physics this can 
       be approximated by polarization terms represented by particle-hole
       excitations. Such excitations are important but 
       would however break the simplicity 
       of our pairing hamiltonian since seniority would no longer be
       a good quantum number. The system can then no longer be block-
       diagonalized in terms of no broken pairs, one broken pair, 
       two, etc etc. The problem to diagonalize becomes then intractable
       if one wants to compute all eigenvalues.


We hope the above comments clarify somewhat more our intentions behind the 
paper. The rich phase structure seen in the microcanonical ensemble
cannot be seen properly in the canonical ensemble due to large energy
fluctuations. 
Large-scale Monte-Carlo calculations in the canonical ensemble by us
support this conclusion. 

We believe these conclusions are new and of interest 
to both nuclear physicists, solid state physicists and those interested
in how to classify phase transitions in finite systems.
