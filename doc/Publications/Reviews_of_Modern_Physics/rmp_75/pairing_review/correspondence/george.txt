 ---- RMP project : Pairing in nuclear systems, by David J. Dean
 ----               and Morten Hjorth-Jensen, deadline 12th december 2001

 Dear George and Karie Friedman,
 we are writing you because we have exceeded the deadline for our
 RMP project. At present we are more or less 70-80% done with the first
 draft. The delay is essentially due to one of us (MHJ) trying to do
 too many other things, especially due to a heavy teaching load, both
 with undergraduate courses and guiding of graduate students.

 However, since we have already some 40 pages, in RMP format, we expect
 to be able to finalize our project within the end of february.
 Would it be possible for you and the editorial staff to extend our
 deadline to february the 20th?

 All the best for a happy X-mas and best wishes for the year to come,
 David and Morten
