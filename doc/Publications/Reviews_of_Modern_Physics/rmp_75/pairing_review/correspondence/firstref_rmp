    Report on review by Dean and Hjorth-Jensen.

   Pairing in nuclear systems is a fascinating phenomenon which
   spreads over the objects differing by orders of magnitude
   in their spatial dimensions with observable consequences.
   It's common background can be traced back to the attractiveness
   of nucleon-nucleon [n-n] interaction at the Fermi energy.
   The feature of attractiveness of n-n interaction is in fact
   a key property which allowed to unify treatment of nuclear
   pairing with original concepts of BCS theory of
   superconductivity. Due to recent development of single-electron
   spectroscopy in ultrasmall metallic grains unity of these
   treatments can now be tested directly on mesoscopic
   level with all consequences of finite size effects.

   Pairing has its roots in BCS [or HFB] i.e in mean-field
   formulation and many concepts of pairing related phenomena
   were born out of mean-field based research. To be clear, neither
   I want to question that nuclear shell-model is considered
   to be much more fundamental than mean-field nor
   want the authors to change a "philosophy" of this overview.
   However, in my opinion one cannot loose sight of
   historical developments/achievements while writing a review of
   pairing related phenomena particularly in finite nuclei.
   Loosely speaking some of the issues discussed in the paper
   are, in my opinion, at least not properly referenced. To be
   more specific let me give just few examples:

   1) Pair-transfer enhancement due to pairing [sect. I2] was discussed
   already in the early 60's by Yoshida. Pair rotational/vibrational
   spectra [also in Sn nuclei what is relevant for sect. IIIB] were
   discussed by Bes, Broglia and cooworkers.

   2) Back-bending phenomenon in high spin spectra was discovered
   by A. Johnson and cooworkers and explained as pair breaking
   phenomenon by Stephens and Simon and credit
   to these works seems to be even more appropriate than to (65;66).

   3) Extensions of BCS/HFB including number projection particularly
   within Lipkin-Nogami approximation are now considered to be almost
   a routine particularly in high-spin applications. None of these
   rather recent developments was even mentioned in the introduction.

   4) It is worth to point out close analogy between quasiparticle
   [single-electron-tunneling] spectra in metallic grains [section IB3]
   and nuclear high spin spectra. The analogy is particularly well
   seen from the perspective of cranking model since Coriolis
   force exerts identical force on nucleonic pair as a magnetic field
   does on Cooper pair in superconductor [\omega <---> H].

   5) I understand that it was not an intention of the authors but
   particularly non-experts reading section IIIB can easily built
   up an impression that importance of 1S0 type pairing in ground
   states of even nuclei is a discovery of late 90's.

   6) Possible connection between Wigner [IIID] energy and isoscalar
   pairing was again first pointed out at the mean-field level, see
   references quoted in (180).

   Since I have jumped over directly to section III -finite nuclei -
   let me continue with this section and eventually
   come back to section II. A preselection of subjects discussed
   here seems to be quite interesting. An attention
   is paid to issues like pn-pairing, random interactions
   or thermal properties which indeed attracted recently a lot of
   attention. Most of these issues are particularly well
   suited for SMMC technique. Generally, I consider this section
   to be well and clearly written. Nevertheless few points need to
   be clarified:

   a) First of all I do not see any argument pointing out towards
   particular importance of 3P2 partial wave [rather strongly
   underlined issue] pairing in finite nuclei.
   Results presented in e.g. table I are not convincing at all.

   b) There is "inflection point" in U(T) curve coming from SMMC
   calculations of 54Fe [page 35]. This leads to a peak in C at
   T\sim 1MeV. However, such a peak is hardly seen for 54Fe in
   Liu-Alhassid calculations. Can it be therefore related to
   thermal pairing collapse [fig 22] or maybe finite-space effects
   are in fact seen earlier, at lower T? Somewhat it is hard to
   believe that details of interactions used in both sets of
   calculations will substantially influence <\Delta^+ \Delta>
   curve of Fig. 22.

   c) Is there any simple-minded argument explaining survival
   of isoscalar pairing versus T [Fig. 22]? It is difficult
   to understand why temperature effects should depend upon
   spin or isospin coupling? This result seems to be also in
   contradiction to other calculations
   see e.g. R\"opke et al. Phys. Rev C61 024306 where strong
   suppression of isoscalar gap with increasing T was reported.

   d) I am not sure but I have certain doubts concerning
   calculations presented in Fig. 25 [pages 40-42]. As far as
   I understand calculations are done for N-Z=4, N-Z=2 and N-Z=0
   i.e. for 20O; 22Ne and 24Mg [and not for 20Ne, 22Ne, 24Mg
   - page 40 last paragraph]. Therefore transfers (71) are
   computed for: <24Mg|P^+|22Mg>; <22Ne|P^+|20Ne> and
   <20O|P^+|18O> respectively. If I am right first two cases
   describe transfers from/to N=Z systems and should be very similar
   what indeed seems to be the case [fig 25, upper panel, left and middle
   pictures]. Can we therefore conclude anything sensible about
   role of T=0 pairing from these two figures?

      Let me now come back to sect. II. It is a nice attempt to
   summarize recent calculations
   of pair gaps in neutron/nuclear matter. It is clearly shown
   that in spite of huge effort thus far
   consensus has been reached essentially only for 1S0 gap
   in case of free-spectrum calculations since in such  case
   gaps are directly related to phase shifts and the phase shifts
   in this partial wave are positive up to E(lab)=250MeV i.e.
   are in the energy range of validity of modern nucleon-nucleon
   potentials. Similar free-spectrum calculations of triplet gaps
   invoking different nn-potentials diverge at higher densities
   since phase shifts are positive over much larger energy range.

   Real theoretical problems starts when one attempts to include
   medium mediated corrections to the spectra both within and
   beyond the BCS limit. Various many-body schemes are used to
   achieve the goal. All of them seem to lead to substantial
   quenching of both triplet as well as singlet pairing but
   the details are strongly model dependent as it is
   nicely illustrated in the paper. Clearly, the authors
   try to avoid details and/or critical comparative analysis
   of these advanced many-body theories. This strategy would
   probably be rather disappointing for advanced readers but
   makes the paper human-readable. However, any human
   [nuclear physicist] who deals with gaps of the order
   of 1MeV and who wants to learn about possible impact
   of 3P2 neutron gap [150keV in relativistic calculations, Fig. 9]
   on thermal dynamics of neutron stars will also stay
   disappointed. Whether or not recent astrophysical observations
   and/or theoretical models set limits for pairing gaps is
   not at all discussed. Instead, there are attempts to link
   these gaps to finite nuclei which is rather risky.
   Indeed, non-relativistic calculations give reasonable value
   for 1S0 pairing but some 5MeV(!) for 3S1-3D1 (isoscalar) while
   relativistic models give essentially no gaps at the
   saturation density.

   Finally let me point out few technical mistakes:

   1) Equation (16) subscript N is missing
   2) Caption to Fig. 11 suggests 3 curves.
   3) Caption to Fig. 12: dotted line is not used; right
      bracket after 37 is misplaced
   4) Page 25; first statement of Sect. IIIA:  "nuclei" is omitted
   5) Eq. (51): bracket ) and argument r_2 are missing
   6) Eq. (52): Greek letters should be used consistently
   7) Table II. It is not clear which row/numbers refer to v=0 and v=2
                overlaps respectively
   8) Section IIIE and IIIF - something went wrong with numbering
      of quoted equations
   9) Caption to Fig. 25; should be "From left to right ...
      N-Z=0,2,4."
  10) Eq. (79): undefined function \sigma(E_\gamma ) is used.
  11) Page 40: is "....J^2 commutes with {\cal T} isospin operator...";
      should be: time-reversal operator?
  12) Page 41: is "...Z=0 case..."
  13) Page 40: is "The three systems 24Mg, 22Ne and 20Ne..." ???
  14) References: spoiled Norwegian(!) names consisting {\o};
                  Ref. [258] should be Dobaczewski

  Generally I have very positive impression concerning this work
  and believe that suggested revisions are rather cosmetic and
  not very time-consuming.
