This is the report of the second referee. Many of the suggestions he
made can be handled easily.
What do you think of the points IV, V,VI and VIII ?

Report on 'Pairing in nuclear systems: from neutron stars to finite
nuclei'
by DJ Dean and M Hjorth-Jensen

  The present work gives an overview of the status of pairing in nuclear
systems. Since nuclear superfluidity is again on the forefront of
interest in nuclear physics this review article comes very timely. In
the first part of the article homogeneous systems like neutron (star)
matter and nuclear matter are considered. The different approaches and
aspects to tackle with the subtle and difficult problem are well
exposed. Instead of enumerating what has been treated, I will give below
a list of items which in my opinion have gotten too little or no
attention at all. The same holds true for the second part on finite
nuclei. There mostly the results of the shell model Monte-Carlo method
has been analysed. Again all is generally well written but some
omissions are present.

Let me come to the homogeneous matter part first:

i)When the pairing Hamiltonian is introduced in sect II.C one misses a
reference to the important works of Richardson who solved this model
exactly in the 60's and whose solution helped a lot to analyse
superconducting metallic grains in the recent past. I can only find a
preprint citation of a work by Richardson which, I think, is not enough.

ii) Formula (29) is almost as old as BCS. One could look up works by
Wilets et al in Phys Rev in the 60's. Relation of gap to phase shifts is
also very old, see eg works by Emery and Sessler,Phys Rev 60's.

iii) Just at the end of II.D there is quite some repetition of what has
bee said already shortly before.

iv) I think the discussion on Proton-neutron pairing remains a bit
short. For instance the important aspect of the transition of Cooper
pairing (high density) to Bose-Einstein condensation of bound deuterons
at low density has not been discussed. In connection with this one may
also touch upon the appearance of a pseudo gap in this channel for T -->
Tc. Works on these subjest by Baldo, Lombardo, Schuck;Bozek; Alm,
Roepke, Schuck, and may be more are worth to be discussed in this
respect.

v) On bottom of p 31 the importance of J=O+ p-n correlations in N+Z
nuxclei are mentioned. I think, to avoid any confusion in this section
on iso sclar and isovector pairing, it would be appropriate to discuss
shortly at the beginning of this section the physical meaning and
distinction of T=1 and T=0 pairs and to enumerate the various channels
possible.

vi) Again in this section I feel that thr discussion is too exclusiveley
based on the shell model approach. For example using boson expansion
techniques, van Isacker and O Juillet have made quite extensive
investigations on T=1 vs T=0 pairing. There exists also very interesting
work by A Goodman with the HFB approach for rotating N=Z nuclei. He
shows how T=0 and T=1 pairs are affected differently by rotation,
discusses band crossings phenomena between T=0 and T=1 rotational
bands,etc. Quite generally the HFB approach which, it is true may have
been treated in other reviews before, is practically not discussed in
the present article. The Wigner energy has also been estimated from n-p
T=0 pairing using a LDA approach by T Alm et al.

vii) In sect V I am missing the mentioning of important recent work on
nuclear level densities including pairing by S Hilaire and by S Goriely.

viii)The only link between nuclear matter and finite nuclei which is
discussed is that in both cases one has predominance of the 1S0 part of
the force. I am missing a further link between nm and finite nuclei
which is LDA. Broglia et al have recently calculated specific heat of
neutron stars with embedded nuclei using such an approach.

Style and misprints.
--------------------

I find the review is written in a style easy to read. The number of
misprints is also very low. Here comes the list of a few I detected:

p 6:  pertaining NOT petaning

      notation NOT nptation

p 20:  neutrino NOT neutrin

p 25:    word 'nuclei' is missing

        remaining NOT reamining

p 40   point after 'studied' is missing

        distribution NOT distrubution

        spontaneously NOT spontaineously

p41    nevertheless  NOT netherhteless

p52    ... the the ... after eq(86)

p54:style:  ... includes... included... in same phrase

    ...contribute...contribution... in same phrase

 p 55:   quadrupole  NOT quadropole
