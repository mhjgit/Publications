>
>Dear Dr. Tveter:
>
>I have carefully read the recent correspondence.  I have also
>discussed this matter with the editors of Physical Review Letters.  I
>am writing you to inform you that we will continue with the
>publication of manuscript LD7766 by Melby et al. "Observation of
>thermodynamical properties..." as recently revised by the authors.
>
>In accordance with our editorial policies authors cannot be required
>to reference material that is not citable.  For the record, the
>relevant earlier PRL publication is cited as reference [9] of which
>you are a coauthor.  Hence, a link to the relevant published work has
>been established.  However, you disagree with the authors that there
>is sufficient attribution of your earlier work in the present paper.
>Both sides have argued the case eloquently citing matters of internal
>publication practice and fairness in the attribution of previous work.
>However, in the absence of a citable reference for the figure in
>question, I am not in a position to help you facilitate resolving the
>conflict.  Had the relevant figure been published, then I might have
>been inclined to ask one of the referees or a Divisional Associate
>Editor to examine further if the present citations are sufficient for
>proper attribution of earlier work.  As is, however, I don't find
>sufficient reason to delay publication of this paper.
>
>I don't imagine that this decision will please you.  However, I
>believe that it is in the best long-term interest of Physical Review
>Letters, its authors, and its readers.  I wish you luck in your future
>scientific work.  And I personally hope that stating the various
>positions in writing has helped both parties open up a communication
>path which might, eventually, lead to a resolution of the remaining
>issues.
