 Abstract will appear in mailing scheduled to begin two hours before
  Tuesday midnight US Mountain time (i.e., Wed 21 Jan 98 05:00:00 GMT).

Your title and abstract will appear in the next mailing exactly as below
(except possibly for the NUMBER which IS NOT OFFICIAL until the next mailing
of abstracts [22:00 LANL time Sun - Thu] -- it cannot be used to cross-list
until after that time.) -- to correct any problems, you MUST replace NOW.
Replacements on the same day (until the 18:00 LANL time deadline Mon - Fri)
do not generate a revised date line, so do not hesitate to replace submission
until everything is perfect (including removal of extraneous files).

Title: Phase Transitions in Rotating Neutron Stars
Author: H. Heiselberg and M. Hjorth-Jensen
Comments: 5 pages, one figure included, revtex latex style
\\
  As rotating neutron stars slow down, the pressure and the density in the core
region increase due to the decreasing centrifugal forces and phase transitions
may occur in the center. We extract the analytic behavior near the critical
angular velocity $\Omega_0$, where the phase transitions occur in the center of
a neutron star, and calculate the moment of inertia, angular velocity, rate of
slow down, braking index, etc. For a first order phase transition these
quantities have a characteristic behavior, e.g., the braking index diverges as
$\sim(\Omega_0-\Omega)^{-1/2}$. Observational consequences for first, second
and other phase transitions are discussed.

Successful submission to the archives can be a significant source of pride
and accomplishment. It entails many serious responsibilities: if you cannot
check off on all of the items below, then you should replace your submission.

  ___ The Title/Author attached above is correct.
     ___ The abstract is complete, correct, and wrapped correctly.
     ___ Capitalization in title correct (we automatically lower case titles
	 with excessive use of upper case, but we get some acronyms incorrect
	 -- replace with uppercase letters only where they should be).
     ___ The authors are listed in `Firstname Lastname' order.
     ___ any anonymous ftp pointers to additional files are given in
         standard url format (e.g. ftp://myhost.domain/path/filename.ext )
     ___ Periods are separated by a space from the end of any URL's
     ___ Any Journal-ref is a complete bibliographic reference to an already
         published version (includes volume and page number info in the case
         of a print journal).
  ___ No raw (uncompressed, un-uuencoded) PostScript was submitted (by e-mail)
  ___ All files including PostScript figures were included.
  ___ This paper has not been `put' to any other xxx e-print archives.
  ___ The text of the paper itself is available directly from the archive.
  ___ The paper can be retrieved uncorrupted (TRY IT).

Submitters who repeatedly leave errors uncorrected may lose submission
privilege to the archives. (Replace using the current tentative papernumber
unless notified otherwise.) If your abstract is improperly wrapped, note that
abstract linefill stops at whitespace indentation (e.g. a blank line or a line
indented with space(s) denotes a new paragraph,and won't be wrapped).

For further hints, keep reading or get the help text by sending a 
message with the subject `help', or see http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/ . Guidelines
for a  properly formatted abstract are given in prep.txt (available via the
`get' command or at http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/prep ). If you have not already
read this, please read it now to ensure that you have followed the guidelines.
The archive admins detest correcting abstracts and your negligence will be
noted, with the possible result of losing future `put' privileges.

If you need to replace this paper, use the `replace' command described in the
help text (available via `help' or at http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/). The format
of the resubmission itself (with \\'s delineating title/abs etc.) is the same
as for `put'.  Your entry will not officially appear in the listings until the
next mailing goes out (and thus cannot yet be accessed via `find' or
`listings' commands), and your papernumber may be shifted until then so it is
preferable to wait a day before cross-listing, etc.

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE `put' TO RESUBMIT THIS PAPER, since that 
will result in a new paper# which will have to be removed by hand
(and in consequence your email address will automatically be added 
to a permanent blacklist whose subsequent queries are ignored).
Instead use the replace command (described in the help text).

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE `put' TO SUBMIT THIS PAPER TO ANOTHER
e-print archive, since it is silly to store the same thing in more than one
place. Instead send a cross-list command (described in the help text) to 
the other e-print archive to generate a cross-listing on it.

Figures should not be appended to the TeX file. Instead all of your files
should be tarred, compressed, and uuencoded, and submitted with the `put'
command or replaced with the `replace' command. The utility `uufiles'
available via `get uufiles' or at http://xxx.lanl.gov/faq/uufaq.html will
help (`get uufiles' returns the Unix version; use the web link or ftp to
ftp://xxx.lanl.gov/software for other platforms).
If you have e-mailed raw PostScript, then it may have been corrupted
in transmission. PostScript should always be compressed and uuencoded
before sending via e-mail -- again, `uufiles' will help with this process.

If your mailer limits the size of your outgoing files, use the `fput' command
(Use `get fput.txt' or http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/fput for further information),
or web upload (see http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/uploads ).

***NOTES***
1) Avoid excessive cross-listings: cross-listings of a paper on archive-x to
 archive-y are intended for subjects of *direct* interest to subscribers of
 archive-y. Those subscribers of archive-y who have peripheral or direct
 interest in the subjects of archive-x are already subscribed to archive-x and
 neither need nor desire multiple receipt of the same abstract. (In particular,
 it is exceedingly unlikely that you could decide what is of direct interest to
 readers of archive-y if you yourself are not an active reader of archive-y.)

2) Statistical fabrication shows that `replaced' papers are not immediately
 rerequested so if your intent is to communicate correct research
 it is in your interest to submit a final version in the first place,
 i.e. *avoid premature submissions*.
 If you absolutely need to replace the paper, it would be helpful to indicate 
 in the Comments: field (i.e. below Authors: ) how serious is the revision
 (e.g. major conceptual changes, minor grammatical changes, etc.), and include
 as a commented header in the revised version of the paper a guide to the
 changes so that interested parties need not be bothered to reaccess
 unnecessarily.
