              The above manuscript has been reviewed by our
        referee(s).

              The resulting reports include a critique which we
        feel is serious enough that it must be answered before we
        can reach a decision on the disposition of the paper. We
        enclose pertinent comments.

              You may choose to resubmit the manuscript with
        revisions you find appropriate.  Please accompany any
        resubmittal by a summary of the changes made, and a brief
        response to all recommendations and criticisms.

                                   Sincerely yours,

                                   Stanley G. Brown

Referee's Report on LN6600 "Phase transitions..." by Heiselberg and
Hjorth-Jensen

This paper presents a calculation of physical features of a rotating
neutron star near a critical velocity for the generic case of
braking-induced phase transitions. The paper is sound and represents
an interesting advance in the ongoing studies of dense matter physics.
However, I do not believe that the reported results should warrant
publication in PRL. This opinion is basically based on the unlikely
observational confirmation of the calculated signatures for
such an event and the
impression that it would not stimulate a specially intense activity
in the field. I feel that the paper, possibly after some expansion,
is more appropiate for a regular article in PRD. A detailed list of
objections and suggestions for improving the manuscript follows:

a) The timescale for the transient is not given and would constitute
a primary need for a dedicated observational program. Too short a
timescale (say hours-days) would need a continuous monitoring of the
possible sources, which is well beyond the capabilities in the
foreseeable future.

b) The value of $\omega^{2} \, \sim \, 10^{-7} \, P^{-2}$ is around
$10^{-4}$ for the Crab pulsar today, there are no candidates in the
$ms$ range (such that $\omega^{2} \, \sim \, 10^{-1}$) spinning
down substantially. The subset of $ms$ pulsars, as is well-known,
present extremely low values of $\dot{P}$ and no signal of
"normal" glitches. The widely accepted scenario that they have been
recycled does not leave room for rotationally-induced phase
transitions either, since all them should have occurred during the
matter-transfer phase.

c) Since the observed $\Omega$ and derivatives are a property of the
crust, a readjustment (energy release ?)
should occur in the case of a first-order
phase transition. The authors may wish to comment on the issue.

d) In the presented models the observed braking index grows towards
3. The only available cases of young pulsars (Crab and Vela) seem
to indicate that $\dot{n_{obs}} \, \leq \, 0$ since their discovery.
This may simply reflect that all phase transitions have already
happened inside them, but it may be useful for the authors. By the
way, it would be useful to distinguish the {\it observational}
quantity $n(\Omega)$ from the {\it theoretical} $n$ exponent that
appears in the power-law in eq.(14).

e) Finally, it would be important to discuss in more detail the
theoretical issue of the simplified eq.(10) vs. the full Hartle's
equations. The lack of space limitation in PRD allows such an
expansion for the benefit of the interested colleagues.

Refree's report on LN6600
Phase transitions in rotating neutron stars
By: Heiselberg and Hjorth-Jensen

This letter reports studies of the interesting behavior a pulsar can
have if a first order phase transition occurs in the steller matter
as the pulsar slows down to a critical angular velocity.  The letter
is well written, however, the authors should comment on the following
conscerns.

1. On page 2, second para, they make the standard approximation of
   slow rotation valid when the period is larger than a few milli-
   seconds.  However, their critical period is just one millisecond.
   Is the approximation valid for the critical period ?

2. Page 7, last line : mantle of quark ( or nucleon ) matter ?

3. It appears that the interesting effects are proportional to the
   change in density, rho_2 - rho_1.  Now if rho_2 - rho_1 is large,
   it is likely that these phases have different charge densities
   without leptons.  One then will necessarily have mixed phase
   regions reducing or eliminating the interesting stucture at
   critical velocity, even for liquid-solid transitions ?

4. The presented study assumes that the latent heat of the phase
   transition has no effect on the dynamics and uses zero temperature
   equation of state.  Is this obvious ?



                                                               elec_sub.asc
                                                               revised 7/97

                 USE ELECTRONIC MODES TO SUBMIT AND RESUBMIT
                      TO THE PR/PRL COMPUSCRIPT PROGRAM

Manuscripts intended for the production compuscript-conversion program should 
be submitted and resubmitted in electronic, not paper, form.  Upload via the 
APS Web-submission site at the URL: http://publish.aps.org/ESUB/, send 
electronic mail to prXtex@aps.org (where X=a, b, c, d, e, or l for Physical 
Review A, B, C, D, E or Letters), or mail a DOS-formatted diskette.  All of 
the textual material of the paper (including tables, captions, etc.) should 
be in electronic form, as a single file. For the initial electronic-mail 
submission, use as the subject ``submit'' followed by the three-letter 
abbreviation for the name of the journal (pra, prb, prc, prd, pre, or prl) 
and the last name of the first author (for example, ``submit pra jones'' or 
``submit PRA Jones''); the first part of the message should consist of a 
filled-out submission form (the blank form is available at the above URL) or 
a submittal letter, giving the postal address of the corresponding author, 
the journal section intended, and other information.

Figures for an electronic submission must be received in at least 
review-quality form before editorial processing can begin.  Web upload or 
electronic-mail transmission (one figure per file) of PostScript-formatted 
figures will normally meet this need.  For color or continuous-tone
PostScript figures, hard-copy originals are also required.  The originals
are needed to ensure that the reproductions created from the electronic
figure files are satisfactory.  (For email transmission, use a subject 
line similar to that for the text file with the addition of the figure 
number, e.g., ``submit pra jones fig1''.)  Alternatively, you could send 
scanner-reproducible journal-quality ``originals'' immediately by overnight 
mail.  A third possibility is to send review-quality figures by fax 
(516-591-4141), while the ``originals'' are sent by conventional or overnight 
mail as soon as possible; please mark the fax transmission as being part of
an electronic-mail submission.  On resubmission, it is only necessary to 
resend your figures if the originals in our file are no longer valid.  

Paper copies of the manuscript text should not be sent as a followup unless 
the electronic-mail transmission has been unsuccessful.  

A diskette submission should be accompanied by a single paper copy of the 
manuscript, and by scanner-reproducible ``original'' figures.

Include the copyright transfer form with the original figures or forward it 
alone by conventional mail.  An electronic version of the form is available 
at the URL http://publish.aps.org/ or via ftp to aps.org in the /pub/jrnls 
directory, as the files copytrnsfr.asc, etc. (but do not return it 
electronically, as we need a handwritten signature).

It is important to confirm the accuracy of bibliographic information in 
references.  This has become more important now that the journal is online.  
Hyperlinks will be programmed to enable readers to ``click'' on references 
and jump directly to the material cited.  If your reference citations are 
incorrect or incomplete (e.g., missing author name, or an incorrect volume 
number or page), the associated hyperlinks may fail, and the usefulness of 
your paper in the online environment may be diminished.

Resubmission must be in electronic form if the paper is to remain eligible 
for the production compuscript-conversion program.  Also, macros and other 
technical problems with the file which have been pointed out by our 
compuscript staff must be eliminated by this stage if the paper is to remain 
eligible.  Resubmission forms are available at http://publish.aps.org/ESUB.  
For an email resubmission, include the filled-out form as the first part of 
the message which contains the modified manuscript; alternatively, provide 
as the first part of the message a summary of changes made and a brief 
response to all recommendations and criticisms, and also state whether or 
not the figures have been modified, and update any other relevant 
information.  Use as the subject of the message ``resub'' followed by the 
manuscript code number and the last name of the first author; for example, 
``resub AB1234 Smith'' or ``resub ab1234 smith''.

For further information about procedures for electronic submission, see the 
General Information for Contributors published in the first issue of each 
volume of the journal, and material available on APS' ftp and World Wide Web 
servers.  In particular consult the document at the URL 
ftp://aps.org/pub/jrnls/esubinform.asc or visit the Web-submission page 
http://publish.aps.org/ESUB.

Morten,

The micro-mini-Workshop here at UMIST is going to take place in the week
beginning  7 June.  We plan to start on monday morning, and intend to
continue until friday. We may wish to use saturday as well, if most of
the participants stay around (or plan an excursion...)

At the moment we know that Morten Hjorth-Jensen, Kalman Varga, Ryoji
Okamoto and Kenji Suzuki will attend. We are working on extending the
list, and shall let you know what happens as soon as we have more
information.

I hope this is still OK with you. Please let me know a.s.a.p. when your
plans have become more definite.
Niels

Hi Morton, 

 My name is Stuart Vincent From the University of Surrey, and my 
boss Paddy Regan has forwarded your name to me regarding shell 
model calcualtions in nuclei around the N=Z=28 shell gap. 
 I am coming to the end of my thesis and I have produced decay 
schemes of yrast states up to about spin 10 hbar in 61Zn, 61Cu 
and 58Ni, with spin assignments made from an angular distribution 
analysis. I wonder if you would be able to help me with shell model 
calcualtions for these nuclei with a view to a joint publication.
Thankyou for your interest,

all the best

  Stuart.
