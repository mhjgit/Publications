 Dear Editors of PRL,

 Concerning: LN6600
    "Phase transitions in rotating neutron stars"
    by Heiselberg,Henning/Hjorth-Jensen,Morten/,
we thank for the referee reports which contains many insightful
comments which has lead to the improved version of our manuscript
which will be resubmitted separately.

 Below we respond to the questions raised and list a number of
modifications to the manuscript. We hope that it is then acceptable
for publication in PRL.


Response to Referee A:

 We thank for the comments that "The paper is sound and represents
an interesting advance in the ongoing studies of dense matter physics."
We argue below that observation is very possible and implore you to
consider the important consequences such an observation of a first
order phase transition would have for dense matter and astrophysics!

a) The timescale of the transients ($t_0$) is implicit in Eq. (13) 
and an example is mentioned in
the following paragraph for the Crab, namely a timescale of a decade.
The timescale for the interesting square root turnover in $\dot{\Omega}$
or singularity in $n(\Omega)$ is somewhat less than that - say about a year.
We now explicitly mention that in the manuscript in the same paragraph:

 ", i.e., $t_0\sim 10 $years for the Crab. Generally,
$t_0\propto\Omega_0^{1-n}$ and the timescale for the transients in
$\dot{\Omega}$ as given by Eq. (13) may be months or centuries. In any
case it would not require continuous monitoring which would help
a dedicated observational program."

b) The referee is correct that the low values of $\dot{P}$ for
observed pulsars does make the transient signal smaller and the range
of P or $\Omega$ values that is covered in a given time interval will
also be smaller.  Yet, the range in P for each pulsar grow with time
as does also the number of observed pulsars. The impressive accuracy
of pulsar period measurements perhaps combined with a dedicated search
does provide hope for discovery of the characteristic
transients. Concerning the millisecond pulsar, note that if the almost
constant period in millisecond pulsars is due to accretion balancing
radiation loss, the accretion will increase central pressures just as
slowing down does and one would observe a similar signal.  The best
candidates for observing the transients would of course be a rapidly
rotating pulsar in a new supernova explosion slowing down at a rapid
rate.  We can expect supernovae several times every century in our
Galaxy and the Magellian Clouds but we cannot estimate how frequent a
pulsar is observed herein. The Crab in 1056 is sofar the most recent
one. The SN1987A kHz signal was unfortunately false. We hope our
work may stimulate a dedicated search which will improve the chances
for discovery. Some of these arguments are mentioned in the summary.
Furthermore we add:
 "We encourage a dedicated search for the characteristic transients
discussed above."

c) Latent heat generated in the phase transition can be ignored.  We
have added the following paragraph to elucidate this point: "If latent
heat is generated in the phase transition, neutrino cooling will
be faster than in supernova explosins. Thus temperatures will drop 
below $\sim 1$MeV in seconds. Such temperatures are
negligible compared to typical Fermi energies of nucleons or quarks
and the timescales are also much smaller than $t_0$."

d) The qualitative behavior of our transients is independent of
the model assumed for the pulsar slow down. There will always appear
a square root behavior in $\dot{\Omega}$ and $n(\Omega)$. The power
law assumption of Eq. (12) is just to connect to standard assumptions
and give concrete examples for the behavior as in Eqs. (13-14).
If the n=3 assumption of (12) disagrees with measurements of the Crab and
Vela pulsars it may disprove the dipole radiation model but it does not
affect our prediction for the square root behavior of transients when
first order phase transitions occur. We have added a sentence mentioning this:
"Although the results in Eqs. (13) and (14) were derived 
for the pulsar slow down assumed in Eq. (12) both
$\dot{\Omega}$ and $(n(\Omega)$ will generally 
display the $\sqrt{t-t_0}$ behavior for $t\ga t_0$ as long as the slow
down is a smooth function of $\Omega$."

We follow the referees suggestion and mention after Eq. (14):
"The  {\it observational} braking index $n(\Omega)$ should be distinguished
from the {\it theoretical} exponent $n$ appearing in Eq. (12)."


e) The generalization of Hartle's equations to include phase
transitions definitely deserves to be worked out, written down and
solved numerically in full detail. This is no simple task and (to our
surprise) most of it is unnecessary for a qualitative and for a 80-90%
quantitative understanding. Of Hartle's six coupled differential
eqs. only the monopole one is important. The others describe
deformations and are small corrections to the moment of inertia.
Similarly, effects of GR as frame dragging, etc., only affects the
moment of inertia by minor quantitative amounts for small and medium
mass neutron stars.  Thus the reduced problem of the simple Eq. (10)
is sufficient to calculate all the important properties of rotating
neutron stars with phase transitions. It allows direct extraction of
the analytic behavior and all the important consequences.
 This is why we believe this short paper is perfect for PRL.

 Fred Lamb (Urbana) has contacted us concerning solving the full GR
problem of rapidly rotating neutron stars. Their many years of
expertise and elaborate codes may make it possible to include full GR,
rapid rotations, accretion, etc., - perhaps in the near future.


Response to Referee B:

1) The example we consider is approximately a millisecond pulsar for
which the slow rotation assumption may not be fully justified. This
may cause some quantitative corrections but not any qualitative. All
of our results in equations are, however, given in terms of $\Omega_0$
and are thus correct for all slower than millisecond pulsars. The
reason we chose a millisecond pulsar in Fig. 1 was just to have a
relatively large $\omega_0$ so that the critical behavior was more
clearly seen in Fig. 1.

2) We thank the referee for noticing this typo. We correct to a
"...mantle of nuclear matter..."

3) The charge density difference between the two phases with an
constant background density of electron to insure average charge
neutrality, is exactly the structure of the mixed phase implicit in
Glendenning's work [2] and discussed in [3]. However, as shown in [3]
the additional surface and Coulomb energies associated with these
structures are important and will change the second order mixed phase
transitions to one or several first order ones. This is discussed at
length in the next to last paragraph. There may also be other phase
transitions involving neutral particles as, e.g., $\pi^0$ condensation
- resulting in an uncomplicated first order phase
transitions. However, the objective of this work is to point out the
important physical consequences of a first order phase transition.
We find it sufficient just to mention possible first order
phase transitions in dense matter. Lacking the EoS for dense matter the
interiors of neutron stars are unknown. This work provides an elegant
method to actually observe possible phase transitions 
thereby obtaining information on the EoS of dense matter.

4) Latent heat does not play any role as discussed above (point c).
