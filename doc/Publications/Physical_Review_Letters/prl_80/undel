Hi David
and happy new year,
hope everything is fine with you, we'll most likely meet again
at the Heenen-wyss workshop in march-april.
I have just a brief q to you:
do we need to resubmit our workshop proposal?
We have basically no changes to the file we sent in
november.
Woudl it be ok if just resub the old stuff?

All the best,
morten
