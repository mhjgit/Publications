As rotating neutron stars slow down, the pressure and the density in
the core region increase due to the decreasing centrifugal
forces and phase transitions may occur in the center. We extract the analytic
behavior near the critical angular velocity $\Omega_0$, where the
phase transitions occur in the center of a neutron star, and calculate
the moment of inertia, angular velocity, rate of slow down, braking
index, etc.  For a first order phase transition these quantities
have a characteristic behavior, e.g., the braking index diverges as
$\sim(\Omega_0-\Omega)^{-1/2}$.  Observational consequences for first,
second and other phase transitions are discussed.
