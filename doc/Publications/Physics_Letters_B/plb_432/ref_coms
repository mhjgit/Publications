Dear Ruprecht, dear Morten,

below you will find two referee reports from Phys.Lett. concerning our
paper on the deuteron. I think we can easily "handle" the suggestions
made by the referee. One of them suggests to add the d/s ratio  calculated
from the various wave functions. We have got the wavefunction in momentum
space. Ruprecht do you know a direct way to calculate this ratio in 
momentum space? 

If you dont have any specific suggestions, I would write a first draft
of a reply, which we would circulate. If you have any good idea, please
let us (Artur and me) know.

Best regards     Herbert

Dear  Dr. Polls

	In view of the comments by the  referees, I am sorry to inform you
that your manuscript:

"Phaseshift equivalent NN potentials and the deuteron"

cannot be accepted for publication in Physics Letters B in its present form.

A suitably revised version might be accepted. It should be sent in
triplicate, with a separate and detailed replies to the referees.

{\bf Referee report} on manuscript Ref:BO255, "Phaseshift equivalent $NN$
potentials and the deuteron" by A. Polls et al.

This work compares $S$ and $D$ wave matrix elements of kinetic and potential
energies of the deuteron for several phase-shift equivalent recent
potentials. The one-pion exchange important contributions are also examined.
Differences are attributed to off-shell differences.

This is an interesting study which should be published after authors have
considered the optimal remarks and revisions mentioned below.

0) The title says ``Phaseshift equivalent $NN$ potentials\ldots ``. It is
true that the quality of the reproduction of the $NN$ data is very good
($\chi ^2$ ~ 1 ) for all the 4 potentials in comparison. Nevertheless it could
well be that the $NN$ data (there could be for instance some differences in
the data sets in use to fit and calculate the $\chi ^2$) are not described in
exactly the same way. This could result in some, although presumably small,
differences in the phase shifts. Such comparison of phases is, I believe,
outside the size of this letter, however some comment about it could be
added and some of the differences shown in this work could be attributed to
this small on-shell differences?

1) It might be quite interesting to add in Table 1 a column giving the
$D/S = \eta $ ratio which has been measured experimentally. Looking at
results of Table 1 it seems that a small $P_D$ could be associated with a
small $V_{SD}$. We understand that the strength of the tensor force plays
here an important role, anything more?

2) It could be instructive to compare also the momentum distribution for the
$D$-wave of the deuteron, i.e. the equivalent of Eq. 2 and Fig. 1 but for
the $D$-wave.

3) For $V_{SD}$ in Fig. 2, the local $OPEP$ seems to be missing. Is there
really a $\delta$-function contribution to the tensor potential? None seems
to appear in any of the shown $V_{SD}$ matrix elements in Figs. 2, 3 and 4.
This is not the case for the $V_{SS}$ where matrix elements of different
potential can differ mainly through a $\delta$-function contribution. Such a
difference is explicitly illustrated in Fig. 2. In Fig. 3, the total Bonn V
and the Bonn $\pi, \rho$ $V_{SS}$ seems to differ mainly by a
$\delta$-function contribution. Any comment? This is also the case in Fig. 4
for the $V_{SS}$ of Argonne, Nijm1, Nijm2 and the low momentum part of Bonn.
It would be good if Authors could comment about it.

4) It seems that in Fig. 3 for $V_{SS}$ of Bonn, for $k \ge$ 800 MeV, the
$OPEP$ matrix element becomes very close to that of the total $V_{SS}$. Is
there any reason or is it just pure coincidence?

5) For an easier reading, authors could add in the upper left part of Fig.~3
the legend "Bonn" and in the upper right part the legend "Argonne" as it has
been done in the lower part.

6) For the same reason, a legend "$V_{SS}$" could be added in the left graph
of Fig. 4.

7) In most case ``Argonne'' has  been shortened in ``Argon'' in Table 1,
Figs. 1, 2 and 4. Authors could introduce this shortened notation. Nijm I
and Nijm II in the texte are denoted Nijm1 and Nijm2 in Figs. 1 and 4, it
will be better to have the same notation.

8) Ref. 7 has been published in Nucl. Phys. {\bf A627} (1997) 85.
Please check if Ref. 6 has been published. Ref. 10 should be "...Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf25} ..." and not "...Phys. Lett. {\bf 25}...".

Re: Ms.# B0255
    "Phaseshift equivalent NN potentials and the deuteron"
By: A. Polls, H. Muther, R. Machleidt, M. Hjorth-Jensen

The authors examine the deuteron solutions of four modern phase-shift
equivalent potentials.  They notice the differences in the S- and D-wave
contributions to both the kinetic and potential energies and point out
there are some significant differences, even though the models produce
similar deuteron observables and nearly identical phase shifts.

I agree with most of the comments made here.  The one exception is the
paragraph following eq.(6).  Here the statement is made that the local
expression for OPE is not really justified.  However we have only on-shell
data to base such a decision on, and both the local and nonlocal models
fit that data, so I don't know what is meant here.  It is not obvious to me
that a heavy-meson-exchange theory necessarily gives a more accurate
representation of the complex QCD interactions that presumably underlie
the short-range NN interaction.  A few lines later the authors find it
remarkable that the Gaussian form factor used with the local OPE in the
Argonne model gives Vsd matrix elements like the nonlocal Bonn, which is
relying on rho-exchange and a much shorter-range form factor.  I think
maybe it isn't SO remarkable, again because they are fitting the same
on-shell data.  I realize the point of the paper is that there are
significant off-shell differences between the models, but I think they
can't be TOO big and still fit the data.  Finally at the end of this
paragraph the authors conclude "that even this long-range part of the NN
interaction is by no means settled."  But I think what is not settled is
how to handle the short-range behavior of OPE, which is not quite the
same thing.

My only other comment is that I think I already knew the content of the
paper, at least qualitatively, and I suspect most people interested in
the subject also know these things.  But it is probably worthwhile having
the detailed numbers in print so the amount of off-shell difference is
quantified.

Fig.2b appears to be missing the "local OPEP" curve.
