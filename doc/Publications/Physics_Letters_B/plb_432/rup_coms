Dear deuteron gang,

these are my comments to the comments of the referees of our paper 
"Phaseshift equivalent ..." (nucl-th/9712055).

Referee A (=first referee in the package):
(I follow his numbering scheme.)
0) He is in prinsipal right: the 4 high-precision potentials are
strictly speaking not phase equivalent; however they fit THE SAME
NN DATA SET (namely, the Nijmegen 1993 NN data set) with 
the same chi^2 per datum. However, even this leaves some room for
variations of phase shifts; and if you look into the phase shift
tables of the Argonne paper and the Nijm paper, you will notice it.
However, I believe that these small differences do in no
way affect what we investigate.

1) Herbert: I can calculate the D/S state ratio for all potentials
in Table I. For CD-Bonn, V_18, Nijm-I, NIjm-II, Bonn A B C, and
Reid'68, I have D/S already.
To calculate this for Argonne V_14, Urbana, pi Bonn, pi local,
and pi Argonne, I need from Herbert the momnetum space deuteron
waves (the way the come out of my deuteron code, if you used it;
it then fits smooth into the my follow-up codes; numerical Fourier
transform into r-space is necessary (which I can do); I do not
know of any "direct" method).

2) A figure analogous to Fig. 1 for D-wave is a good idea;
let's include it.

3) We may add in the caption of Fig. 2: 
For V_SD, local OPEP = local OPE - delta, because
the tensor potential has no delta function
(the referees are obviously not too smart).

4) pure coincidence.

5) agreed.

6) agreed.

7) agreed; it's always good to have consistent notation.

8) fine.



Referee B:
Concerning paragraph two of his report:
One-pion-exchange is a Feynman diagram. The correct result for
this Feynman diagram is what the correct (i.e., non-approximated)
evaluation of this diagram according to the (quantum field
theoretic) Feynman rules yield. This yields the relativistic OPE.
If someone uses something else, he
makes approximations to this correct result, e.g. the local
approximation. If an approximation is justified or not is, in general,
in physics investigated by comparing the exact result with
the approximation. If there are large differences, we usually have
doubts if the approximation is good or justified. Fig. 2 reveals that the
differences are large.

We may not explain this as stubbornly as I just did; but I guess
this is our point of view here.


With best regards to all of you,

Ruprecht.
