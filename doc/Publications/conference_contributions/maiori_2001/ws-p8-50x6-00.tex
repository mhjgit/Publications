\maketitle

\abstracts{
This is where the abstract should be placed. It should consist
of one paragraph and give a concise summary of the material in
the article below.  Replace the title, authors, and addresses
within the curly brackets with your own title, authors, and
addresses. You may have as many authors and addresses as you wish.
It's preferable not to use footnotes in the abstract or the
title; the acknowledgments for funding bodies etc. are placed in
a separate section at the end of the text.}

\section{Guidelines}
\subsection{Producing the Hard Copy}\label{subsec:prod}
The hard copy may be printed using the advice given in the file
{\em readme$\_$2e.txt}, which is repeated in this section. You should
have three files in total.\footnote{You can obtain these files
from our WWW pages at:

\noindent
{\sf http://www.wspc.com/others/style\_files/proceedings/proceedings\_style\_files.html}

\noindent
{\sf http://www.wspc.com.sg/others/style\_files/proceedings/proceedings\_style\_files.html} }

\noindent {\em readme$\_$2e.txt} --- the preliminary guide.

\noindent {\em ws-p8-50x6-00.cls} --- the class file that provides the higher
level latex commands for the proceedings. Don't change these parameters.

\noindent {\em ws-p8-50x6-00.tex} --- the main text. You can delete our
sample text and replace it with your own contribution to the
volume, however we recommend keeping an initial version of the
file for reference.  Strip off any mail headers and then latex
the tex file.  The command for latexing is {\sf latex ws-p8-50x6-00},
do this twice to sort out the cross-referencing.

If you wish to use some other form of word-processor, some
guidelines are given in Sec.~\ref{subsec:wpp} below.  These
files will work with standard latex2e. If there is an
abbreviation defined in the new definitions at the top of the
file {\em  ws-p8-50x6-00.tex} that conflicts with one of your own
macros, then delete the appropriate command and revert to
longhand. Failing that, please consult your local texpert to
check for other conflicting macros that may be unique to your
computer system.  Page numbers are included at the bottom of the
page for your guidance. Do not worry about the final pagination
of the volume which will be done after you submit the paper.

\subsection{Using Other Word-Processing Packages}\label{subsec:wpp}
If you want to use some other form of word-processor to
construct your output, and are using the final hard copy version
of these files as guidelines; then please follow the style given
here for headings, table and figure captions, and the footnote
and citation marks.  For this size of volume, the final page
dimensions will be 8.5 by 6 inches (21.5 by 15.25 cm) however
you should submit the copy on standard A4 paper. The text area,
which includes the page numbers should be 7 by 4.7 inches (17.75
by 12 cm).  The text should be in 10pt roman for the title,
section heads and the body of the text, and 9pt for the authors'
names and addresses.  Please use capitals for the title and
authors, bold face for the title and headings, and italics for
the subheadings.  The abstract, footnotes, figure and table
captions should be in 8pt.

It's also important to reproduce the spacing of the text and
headings as shown here. Text should be slightly more than
single-spaced; use a baselineskip (which is the average distance
from the base of one line of text to the base of an adjacent
line) of 13 pts and 10 pts for footnotes.  All headings should
be separated from the text preceding it by a baselineskip of
about 26 pts and use a baselineskip of about 18 pts for the
following text.

Paragraphs should have a first line indented by about 0.25in
(6mm) except where the paragraph is preceded by a heading and
the abstract should be indented on both sides by 0.25in (6mm)
from the main body of the text.

\subsection{Headings and Text and Equations}
Please preserve the style of the headings, text fonts and line
spacing to provide a uniform style for the proceedings volume.

Equations should be centered and numbered consecutively, as in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:murnf}), and the {\em eqnarray} environment may be
used to split equations into several lines, for example in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:sp}), or to align several equations.  An alternative
method is given in Eq.~(\ref{eq:spa}) for long sets of equations
where only one referencing equation number is wanted.

In latex, it is simplest to give the equation a label, as in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:murnf}) where we have used 
{\em $\backslash$label\{eq:murnf\}} to identify the equation.
You can then use the reference {\em $\backslash$ref\{eq:murnf\}}
when citing the equation in the text which will avoid the need
to manually renumber equations due to later changes. (Look at
the source file for some examples of this.)

The same method can be used for referring to sections 
and subsections.

\subsection{Tables}
The tables are designed to have a uniform style throughout the
proceedings volume. It doesn't matter how you choose to place
the inner lines of the table, but we would prefer the border
lines to be of the style shown in Table~\ref{tab:exp}.  
The top and bottom horizontal lines should be single 
(using {\em $\backslash$hline}), and there should be single 
vertical lines on the perimeter, (using 
{\em  $\backslash$begin\{tabular\}\{$|...|$\}}).  For the inner
lines of the table, it looks better if they are kept to a
minimum. We've chosen a more complicated example purely as an 
illustration of what is possible.

The caption heading for a table should be placed at the top of
the table.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Experimental Data bearing on $\Gamma(K \rightarrow \pi \pi \gamma)$
for the $K^0_S$, $K^0_L$ and $K^-$ mesons.\label{tab:exp}}
\begin{center}
\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|l|}
\hline
{} &\raisebox{0pt}[13pt][7pt]{$\Gamma(\pi^- \pi^0)\; s^{-1}$} &
\raisebox{0pt}[13pt][7pt]{$\Gamma(\pi^-\pi^0\gamma)\; s^{-1}$} &{}\\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\raisebox{0pt}[12pt][6pt]{Process 
for Decay}} & &\\
\cline{1-2}
$K^-$   &$1.711 \times 10^7$ 
&\begin{minipage}{1in}
\begin{center}
$2.22 \times 10^4$ \\ (DE $ 1.46 \times 10^3)$
\end{center}\end{minipage} 
&\begin{minipage}{1.5in}
\phantom{xxx}

$E^{\ast}_{\gamma} = 80$ to $100$~MeV
\end{minipage} \\[22pt]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Figures}
If you wish to `embed' a postscript figure in the file, 
then remove the \% mark
from the declaration of the postscript figure {\em epsfbox} within the figure
description and change the filename to an appropriate one. Also
remove the comment \% mark from the {\em epsfxsize} command and specify the required width of the figure.
System will automatically enlarge or reduce the figure based on the {\em x-size} provided with {\em epsfxsize} command. 
You may need to play around with this as different computer systems
appear to use different commands. If you like to have an empty box
size to the image you can just fill in the {\em x, y size} against the
command {\em figurebox}, which has three arguments. The thrid argument
is for actual figure name.

\begin{figure}[t]
\figurebox{20pc}{15pc}{} % to have a box alone
%\epsfxsize=10pc % will enlarge or reduce the postscript figures based on the xsize
%\epsfbox{xxx.eps} % postscript image file name
\caption{A generalized cactus tree: the confluent
transfer-matrix $S$ transforms the state function $f(x)$ and
$f(z)$ into $f(x)$.  \label{fig:radish}}
\end{figure}

Next adjust the scaling of the figure until it's correctly
positioned, and remove the declarations of the lines and any
anomalous spacing.

If you prefer to use some other method then it's very important
to leave the correct amount of vertical space in the figure
declaration to accomodate your figure (remove the lines and
change the vspace in the example.) Send the hard copy figures on
separate pages with clear instructions to match them to the
correct space in the final hard copy text. Please ensure the
final hard copy figure is correctly scaled to fit the space
available (this ensures the figure is legible.)

The caption heading for a figure should be placed below the
figure.

\subsection{Limitations on the Placement of Tables,
Equations and Figures}\label{sec:plac}
Very large figures and tables should be placed on a page by themselves. One
can use the instruction {\em $\backslash$begin\{figure\}$[$p$]$} or
{\em $\backslash$begin\{table\}$[$p$]$}
to position these, and they will appear on a separate page devoted to
figures and tables. We would recommend making any necessary
adjustments to the layout of the figures and tables
only in the final draft. It is also simplest to sort out line and
page breaks in the last stages.

\subsection{Acknowledgments, Appendices, Footnotes and the Bibliography}
If you wish to have acknowledgments to funding bodies etc.,
these may be placed in a separate section at the end of the
text, before the Appendices. This should not be numbered so use
{\em $\backslash$section$\ast$\{Acknowledgments\}}.

It's preferable to have no appendices in a brief article, but if more
than one is necessary then simply copy the
{\em $\backslash$section$\ast$\{Appendix\}}
heading and type in Appendix A, Appendix B etc. between the brackets.

Footnotes are denoted by a letter superscript
in the text,\footnote{Just like this one.} and references
are denoted by a number superscript.
We have used {\em $\backslash$bibitem} to produce the bibliography.
Citations in the text use the labels defined in the bibitem declaration,
for example, the first paper by Jarlskog~\cite{ja} is cited using the command
{\em $\backslash$cite\{ja\}}.

If you more commonly use the method of square brackets in the line of text
for citation than the superscript method,
please note that you need  to adjust the punctuation
so that the citation command appears after the punctuation mark.

\subsection{Final Manuscript}
The final hard copy that you send must be absolutely clean and unfolded.
It will be printed directly without any further editing. Use a printer
that has a good resolution (300 dots per inch or higher). There should
not be any corrections made on the printed pages, nor should adhesive
tape cover any lettering. Photocopies are not acceptable.

The manuscript will not be reduced or enlarged when filmed so please ensure
that indices and other small pieces of text are legible.

\section{Sample Text}
The following may be (and has been) described as `dangerously irrelevant'
physics. The Lorentz-invariant phase space integral for
a general n-body decay from a particle with momentum $P$
and mass $M$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
I((P - k_i)^2, m^2_i, M) = \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^5}\!
\int\!\frac{d^3 k_i}{2 \omega_i} \! \delta^4(P - k_i).
\label{eq:murnf}
\end{equation}
The only experiment on $K^{\pm} \ra \pi^{\pm} \pi^0 \gamma$ since 1976
is that of Bolotov {\it et al}.~\cite{bu} 
There are two necessary conditions required for any acceptable 
parametrization of the quark mixing matrix. The first is that
the matrix must be unitary, and the second is that it should
contain a CP violating phase $\delta$. In Sec.~\ref{subsec:wpp}
the connection between invariants (of form similar to J) and
unitarity relations will be examined further for the more
general $ n \times n $ case. The reason is that such a matrix is
not a faithful representation of the group, i.e.~it does not
cover all of the parameter space available. 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bf{K} & = &  Im[V_{j, \alpha} {V_{j,\alpha + 1}}^*
{V_{j + 1,\alpha}}^* V_{j + 1, \alpha + 1} ] \\[4pt]
&&{}+ Im[V_{k, \alpha + 2} {V_{k,\alpha + 3}}^*
{V_{k + 1,\alpha + 2}}^* V_{k + 1, \alpha + 3} ]  \\[4pt]
&&{}+ Im[V_{j + 2, \beta} {V_{j + 2,\beta + 1}}^*
{V_{j + 3,\beta}}^* V_{j + 3, \beta + 1} ]  \\[4pt]
&&{}+ Im[V_{k + 2, \beta + 2} {V_{k + 2,\beta + 3}}^*
{V_{k + 3,\beta + 2}}^* V_{k + 3, \beta + 3}] \\[4pt]
& & \\
\bf{M} & = &  Im[{V_{j, \alpha}}^* V_{j,\alpha + 1}
V_{j + 1,\alpha} {V_{j + 1, \alpha + 1}}^* ]  \\[4pt]
&&{}+ Im[V_{k, \alpha + 2} {V_{k,\alpha + 3}}^*
{V_{k + 1,\alpha + 2}}^* V_{k + 1, \alpha + 3} ]  \\[4pt]
&&{}+ Im[{V_{j + 2, \beta}}^* V_{j + 2,\beta + 1}
V_{j + 3,\beta} {V_{j + 3, \beta + 1}}^* ]  \\[4pt]
&&{}+ Im[V_{k + 2, \beta + 2} {V_{k + 2,\beta + 3}}^*
{V_{k + 3,\beta + 2}}^* V_{k + 3, \beta + 3}],
\\ & &
\end{array}\label{eq:spa}
\end{equation}
where $ k = j$ or $j+1$ and $\beta = \alpha$ or $\alpha+1$, but if
$k = j + 1$, then $\beta \neq \alpha + 1$ and similarly, if
$\beta = \alpha + 1$ then $ k \neq j + 1$.\footnote{An example of a
matrix which has elements
containing the phase variable $e^{i \delta}$ to second order, 
i.e.~elements with a phase variable $e^{2i \delta}$ is given at
the end of this section.} There are only 162 quark mixing
matrices using these parameters which are 
to first order in the phase variable $e^{i \delta}$ as is the case for
the Jarlskog parametrizations, and for which J is not identically
zero.
It should be noted that these are physically identical and
form just one true parametrization.
\bea
T & = & Im[V_{11} {V_{12}}^* {V_{21}}^* V_{22}]  \nonumber \\[4pt]
&&{}+ Im[V_{12} {V_{13}}^* {V_{22}}^* V_{23}]   \nonumber \\[4pt]
&&{}- Im[V_{33} {V_{31}}^* {V_{13}}^* V_{11}].
\label{eq:sp}

\section*{Acknowledgments}
This is where one places acknowledgments for funding bodies etc.
Note that there are no section numbers for the Acknowledgments, Appendix
or References. Furthermore, the system will automatically generate the heading for 
the reference section.


\section*{Appendix}
We can insert an appendix here and place equations so that they
are given numbers such as Eq.~(\ref{eq:app}).
\be
x = y.
