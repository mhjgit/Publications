Instructions for producing a Camera-Ready Manuscript
using World Scientific Publishing Latex2e Style Files

The hard copy may be produced using the instructions given in 
this file. You should have four files in total:

readme_2e.txt		-- this preliminary guide.

ws-p8-50x6-00.cls	-- the class/style file that provides the higher
			   level latex2e commands for the proceedings. 
			   Don't change these parameters.
ws-p8-50x6-00.tex	-- the main text. Change at appropriate places
			   but we recommend keeping one initial version of 
			   the file for reference before deleting the main 
			   parts of the text.
ws-p8-50x6-00.pdf	-- sample typeset pages of the above tex file.

These files will work with standard Latex2e package. If there is an
abbreviation defined in the new definitions at the top of the
file ws-p8-50x6-00.tex that conflicts with one of your own macros, then
delete the appropriate command and revert to longhand. Failing
that, please consult your local texpert to check for other
conflicting macros that may be unique to your computer system.
Page numbers are included at the bottom of the page for your
guidance. Do not worry about the final pagination of the volume
which will be done after you submit the paper.
