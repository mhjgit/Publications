\abstract{
Various perturbative and non-perturbative many-body techniques
are discussed. Especially, we will focus on the summation
of so-called Parquet diagrams with emphasis on applications 
for finite nuclei.
Here, the subset of two-body Parquet equations will be discussed. A 
practical implementation of the corresponding equations
for studies of effective interactions
for the nuclear shell model is outlined. 
Summation of three-body diagrams are also discussed.}
