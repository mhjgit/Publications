Various perturbative and non-perturbative many-body techniques are
discussed in this work. Especially, we will focus on the summation of
so-called Parquet diagrams with emphasis on applications to finite
nuclei.  Here, the subset of two-body Parquet equations will be
discussed. A practical implementation of the corresponding equations
for studies of effective interactions for finite nuclei is outlined. }


\section{Introduction}


Traditional shell-model studies have recently received a renewed
interest through large scale shell model calculations in both the
$1p0f$ shell and the $2s1d0g_{7/2}$ shells with the inclusion of the
$0h_{11/2}$ intruder state as well.  It is now fully possible to
perform large-scale shell-model investigations and study the
excitation spectra for systems with some 10 million basis states. With
recent advances in Monte Carlo methods one is also able to enlarge the
dimensionality of the systems under study considerably, and important
information on, e.g., ground state properties has thereby been
obtained.

An important feature of such large scale calculations
is that it allows one to probe the underlying many-body
physics in a hitherto unprecedented way.
The crucial starting point in all such shell-model 
calculations is
the derivation of an effective interaction, be it
either through an approach based on a microscopic theory
starting from the free nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interaction 
\index{nuclear interaction!free space}
or through a more phenomenological approach.  For example, in
shell-model studies of the Sn isotopes one may have up to 31 valence
particles or holes interacting via an effective two-body
interaction. The results of such calculations can therefore yield,
when compared with the avaliable body of experimental data, critical
inputs to the underlying theory of the effective interaction.  Until
very recently, realistic shell-model effective interactions have
mainly been applied to nuclei with two or a few valence particles
beyond closed shells, such as the oxygen and calcium isotopes. Thus,
by going to the tin isotopes, in which the major neutron shell between
neutron numbers 50 and 82 is being filled beyond the $^{100}$Sn 
\index{100Sn@$^{100}$Sn}
closed
shell core, we have the opportunity of testing the potential of
large-scale shell-model calculations as well as the reliability of
realistic effective interactions in systems with many valence
particles.

Clearly, although the $NN$ interaction is of short
but finite range, with typical interparticle
distances in nuclei of the order of $1\sim 2$ fm, there are  
indications from studies of both few-body systems such as the triton and
of infinite nuclear matter, that at least three-body
interactions, both real and effective ones, may be of
importance. \index{nuclear interaction!three body}
Thus, with many valence nucleons present, such
large-scale shell-model calculations may
tell us how well, e.g., an effective interaction 
\index{nuclear interaction!effective}
which only includes two-body terms does in
reproducing properties such as excitation spectra and
binding energies. 

This chapter deals  with various ways of deriving the effective
interactions
\index{nuclear interaction!effective}
and effective operators needed in shell-model calculations,
starting from the free $NN$ interaction.  Normally, the problem of
deriving such effective operators and interactions is solved in a
limited space, the so-called model space, which is a subspace of the
full Hilbert space. An effective operator \index{effective operator}
and interaction theory is
then introduced in order to systematically take into account
contributions from the complement of the chosen
model space (the excluded space). 
Several formulations for such expansions of effective
operators and interactions exist in the literature, following
time-dependent or time-independent perturbation theory
\cite{Morten:so95,Morten:brandow67,Morten:ko90,%
Morten:hko95,Morten:lm85,Morten:so84}.
Formulations like the coupled-cluster method \index{coupled-cluster method}
or exponential ansatz
\cite{Morten:lm85,Morten:arponen97,Morten:lk72a,Morten:lk72b,%
Morten:zabolitzky74,Morten:klz78,Morten:ticcm,Morten:hm98},
the summation of the Parquet class of diagrams 
\cite{Morten:dm64,Morten:nozieres,Morten:babu,Morten:jls82,%
Morten:br86,Morten:scalapino,Morten:ym96,Morten:dya97},
\index{Parquet theory}
or the so-called $\hat{Q}$-box method with the folded-diagram formulation of
\index{Q box method@$\hat{Q}$ box!method}
\index{folded diagrams}
Kuo and co-workers \cite{Morten:ko90,Morten:hko95} have been
extensively applied to systems in nuclear, atomic, molecular and
solid-state physics.  Here we will focus on the above-mentioned
$\hat{Q}$-box approach and the summation of the so-called Parquet
diagrams.  For the description of other many-body methods such as the
hypernetted-chain or the correlated basis function
\cite{Morten:adelchi98} methods, Monte-Carlo related methods
\cite{Morten:david97,Morten:vijay}, unitary-correlation operator method 
\cite{Morten:so84},   see chapters \ref{chap:adelchi}, \ref{chap:wiringa}
and \ref{chap:ryoiji}, respectively.

The $\hat{Q}$ box has been introduced in Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger
perturbation theory as the sum of all non-folded diagrams to a
given order in the expansion parameter. In nuclear physics this is the
so-called $G$ matrix.
\index{G matrix@$G$ matrix}
The $G$ matrix renders the free $NN$  interaction $V$, which
is repulsive at small internucleon distances,  tractable
for a perturbative analysis through the summation of ladders diagrams
to infinite order. Stated differently, the $G$ matrix, through the
solution of the 
Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone  equation, 
\index{Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone equation}
accounts for short-range correlations involving high-lying states.
Folded diagrams are a class of diagrams which arise
due to the removal of the dependence of the exact model-space energy
in the Brillouin-Wigner perturbation expansion. Through the $\hat{Q}$-box
formulation and its derivatives, this set of diagrams can easily be summed
up. 

In addition to the evaluation of folded diagrams and the inclusion
of ladder diagrams to infinite order included in the $G$ matrix, there
are other classes of diagrams which can be summed up. 
\index{G matrix@$G$ matrix}
These take into account
the effect of long-range correlations involving low-energy excitations.
Another set of frequently applied formalisms are either
the Tamm-Dancoff (TDA)
\index{Tamm-Dancoff approximation|see{TDA}}\index{TDA}
or the random-phase
\index{random-phase approximation|see{RPA}}\index{RPA}
(RPA) approximations. In their traditional formulation one allows for
the summation of all particle-hole excitations, 
for TDA with only forward-going and for RPA with 
backward going insertions as well.  This set of diagrams, see e.g., 
Refs.\ 
\cite{Morten:kirson74,Morten:eo77}, should account for correlations arising
from collective particle-hole correlations. Another possibility, is to
include any number of particle-particle and hole-hole correlations in
the screening of particle-hole correlations.  The inclusion of these
kind of correlations is conventionally labelled particle-particle (pp)
RPA.
\index{RPA!pp (particle-particle)}
 It has been used both in nuclear matter
studies \cite{Morten:angels88,Morten:rpd89,Morten:yhk86,Morten:syk87}
and in evaluations of ground state properties of closed-shell
nuclei \cite{Morten:hmtk87,Morten:emm91,Morten:hmm95}.
Recently, Ellis, Mavromatis and M\"uther \cite{Morten:emm91,Morten:hmm95} have
extended the pp RPA to include the particle-hole (ph) RPA, 
\index{RPA!ph (particle-hole)}
though
screening of two-particle-one-hole (2p1h) and two-hole-one-particle
(2h1p) vertices was not included.
These latter works can be viewed as a step towards the full summation of the
Parquet class of diagrams. 
The summation of the Parquet diagrams entails a self-consistent
summation of both particle-particle and hole-hole ladder diagrams
and particle-hole diagrams. Practical solutions to this many-body
scheme for finite nuclei will be discussed here.

This work falls in six sections.
In the next section we present various definitions pertinent
to the determination of effective interactions, with an emphasis
on perturbative methods.
The resummation of the ladder type of 
diagrams is then presented in Sec.~\ref{Morten:sec:sec3}.
In that section we also discuss the summation of so-called
folded diagrams which arise in the evaluation of 
valence space effective interactions. Further perturbative 
corrections are also discussed and selected results
for light nuclei in the $1s0d$ and $1p0f$ shells and for
Sn isotopes are presented.

The summation of the TDA and RPA class of diagrams is discussed in
Sec.~\ref{Morten:sec:sec4}. Other screening corrections are also
discussed in that section. The self-consistent approach to the 
summation of both ladder type diagrams and screening terms 
through the solution    
of equations for the Parquet class of diagrams will be presented
in Sec.~\ref{Morten:sec:sec5}. 
Concluding remarks are given in Sec.~\ref{Morten:sec:sec6}.



\section{Perturbative methods}
\label{Morten:sec:sec2}


In order to derive a microscopic approach to the effective interaction and/or operator 
within the framework of perturbation theory, we need to introduce various
notations and definitions pertinent to the methods exposed.
In this section we review how to calculate an effective 
interaction within the framework of 
degenerate Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger
(RS) perturbation theory \cite{Morten:ko90,Morten:lm85}. 
\index{perturbation theory!Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger}
It is common practice in perturbation theory to reduce the infinitely
many degrees of freedom of the Hilbert space to those represented
by a physically motivated subspace, the model space.
In such truncations of the Hilbert space, the notion of a projection
operator $P$ onto the model space and its complement $Q$ are
introduced. The projection operators defining the model and excluded
spaces are defined by
\begin{equation}
        P=\sum_{i=1}^{D} \left|\phi_i\right\rangle
        \left\langle\phi_i\right |,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
        Q=\sum_{i=D+1}^{\infty} \left|\phi_i\right\rangle
        \left\langle\phi_i\right |,
\end{equation}
with $D$ being the dimension of the model space, and $PQ=0$, $P^2 =P$,
$Q^2 =Q$ and $P+Q=I$. The wave functions $\left|\phi_i\right\rangle$ 
are eigenfunctions
of the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0 = T+U$, where $T$ is the kinetic
energy and $U$ and appropriately chosen one-body potential, that of the
harmonic oscillator (HO) in most calculations. The full Hamiltonian
is then rewritten as $H=H_0 +H_1$ with $H_1=V-U$, $V$ being the
$NN$    interaction. The eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions of the full Hamiltonian are denoted by
$\left|\Psi_{i}\right\rangle$
and $E_{i}$,
\begin{equation}
                H\left|\Psi_{i}\right\rangle= 
                E_{i}\left|\Psi_{i}\right\rangle.
\end{equation}
Rather than solving the full Schr\"{o}dinger equation above, we define
an effective Hamiltonian acting within the model space such
that
\begin{equation}
               PH_{\mathrm{eff}}P\left|\Psi_{i}\right\rangle=
               E_{i}P\left|\Psi_{i}\right\rangle=
              E_{i}\left|\phi_{i}\right\rangle
\end{equation}
where $\left|\phi_{i}\right\rangle=P\left|\Psi_{i}\right\rangle$
is the projection of the full wave function
onto the model space, the model space wave function.
In RS perturbation theory, the effective interaction
$H_{\mathrm{eff}}$ can be written out order by order in the 
interaction $H_1$ as
\begin{equation}
               PH_{\mathrm{eff}}P=PH_1P +PH_1\frac{Q}{e}H_1 P+
               PH_1\frac{Q}{e}H_1 \frac{Q}{e}H_1 P+\dots,
               \label{Morten:eq:effint}
\end{equation}
where terms of third and higher order also
include the aforementioned folded diagrams. \index{folded diagrams}
Further, $e=\omega -H_0$,
where $\omega$ is the so-called starting energy, defined as the unperturbed
energy of the interacting particles. \index{starting energy}
Similarly,
the exact wave
function $\left|\Psi_{i}\right\rangle$
can now be written in terms of the model space wave function as
\begin{equation}
                \left|\Psi_{i}\right\rangle=
                \left|\phi_{i}\right\rangle+
                \frac{Q}{e}H_1\left|\phi_{i}\right\rangle
                +\frac{Q}{e}H_1\frac{Q}{e}H_1\left|\phi_{i}\right\rangle
                +\dots \equiv \Omega \ket{\phi_i}
                \label{Morten:eq:wavef}
\end{equation}
The wave operator $\Omega$ is often expressed as \index{wave operator}
\begin{equation}
              \Omega = 1 +\chi,
\end{equation}
where $\chi$ is known as the correlation operator. 
\index{correlation operator}
The correlation
operator generates the component of the wave function in the $Q$-space
and must therefore contain at least one perturbation. Observing
that $P\Omega P = P$, we see that the correlation operator $\chi$
has the properties
\begin{equation}
               P\chi P = 0, \hspace{1cm} Q\Omega P = 
              Q\chi P =\chi P. \label{Morten:eq:chi1}
\end{equation}
Since  $\left|\Psi_i\right\rangle=\Omega\left|\phi_i\right\rangle$ 
determines the wave operator
only when it operates to the right on the model space, i.e., only the
$\Omega P$  part is defined, the term $\Omega Q$
never appears in the theory,
and we could therefore add the conditions $Q\chi Q =0$ and $P\chi Q =0$
to Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:chi1}). This leads to the following choice for $\chi$
\begin{equation}
                   \chi = Q\chi P. \label{Morten:eq:chi2}
\end{equation}
This is the traditional choice in perturbation theory \cite{Morten:so95,Morten:lm85}.

      \caption{The various vertices 
               $V$ which contribute to the wave operator

               The Hartree-Fock
               terms are not included. Possible hermitian conjugate 
                diagrams are also not shown. The arrows indicate the 
               angular momentum coupling order.}
      \label{Morten:fig:wavef1}
\end{figure}


The wave operator $\Omega$ can then be ordered in terms of the number
of interactions with the perturbation $H_1$
\begin{equation}
              \Omega = 1 +\Omega^{(1)} + \Omega^{(2)}+\dots ,
\end{equation}
where $\Omega^{(n)}$ means that we have $n$ $H_1$ terms. 
Explicitely, the above
equation reads
\begin{eqnarray}
         \Omega\left|\phi_i\right\rangle=
         &{\displaystyle\left|\phi_i\right\rangle
         +\sum_{\alpha}\frac{\left|\alpha\right\rangle
         \left\langle\alpha\right|
          H_1\left|\phi_i\right\rangle}{\varepsilon_i -\varepsilon_{\alpha}}
         +\sum_{\alpha\beta}\frac{\left|\alpha\right\rangle
        \left\langle\alpha\right| H_1
         \left|\beta\right\rangle\left\langle\beta\right| H_1
         \left|\phi_i\right\rangle }
         {(\varepsilon_i-\varepsilon_{\alpha})
       (\varepsilon_i-\varepsilon_{\beta})} }\\   \label{Morten:eq:wavefu}\nonumber
&       {\displaystyle  -\sum_{\alpha j}\frac{\left|\alpha\right\rangle
       \left\langle\alpha\right|
         H_1\left|\phi_j\right\rangle
        \left\langle\phi_j\right| H_1\left|\phi_i\right\rangle}
       {(\varepsilon_i-\varepsilon_{\alpha})
      (\varepsilon_i-\varepsilon_{j})} }
       +\dots ,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\varepsilon$ are the unperturbed energies of the $P$-space
and $Q$-space states defined by $H_0$.
The greek letters refer to
$Q$-space states, whereas a latin letter refers to model-space
states.   The second term
in the above equation corresponds to $\Omega^{(1)}$ while the third
and fourth define $\Omega^{(2)}$.
Note that the fourth term diverges
in case we have a degenerate or nearly degenerate model space. It is
actually divergencies like these which are to be removed by the folded
diagram procedure to be discussed in the next section. Terms like these
arise due to the introduction of an energy independent perturbative
expansion. Conventionally, the various contributions to the
perturbative expansion can be  represented by way of Goldstone 
or Feynman diagrams.
In Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:wavef1} we display the topologically distinct
contributions to first order in the
interaction $V$ to
the wave operator Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:wavefu}). These diagrams all
define the correlation operator $\chi$ to first order in $V$.
Diagrams with Hartree-Fock contributions \index{Hartree-Fock!contributions}
and single-particle potential terms 
have not been included. The possible 
renormalisations of these diagrams will be discussed
in the next three sections.
The reader should note that with respect to
the nomenclature in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:wavefu}), we will hereafter 
employ the following notation in our discussion of various diagrams
and vertex renormalisations:
\begin{itemize}
\item roman letters $p,q,r,s,t,\dots$ refer to particle single-particle
states, either
within the model-space or from the excluded space. An arrow pointing
upwards represents such a particle state. 
\item greek letters $\alpha ,\beta ,\gamma ,\delta \dots$ refer to hole
single-particle states. An arrow pointing downward is a hole state.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Expressions for the wave operator}

      \caption{Coupling order for the $[12]$ (a), $[13]$ (b) and
               $[14]$ (c) channels.}
      \label{Morten:fig:channelsdef}
\end{figure}


We end this section with the equations for the diagrams
in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:wavef1} representing $\chi$ to first order in $V$.
Moreover, in order to introduce the various channels needed to sum the 
\index{Parquet diagrams}
Parquet class of diagrams, we will find it convenient here to
classify these channels in terms of angular momentum 
\index{angular momentum!recoupling}
recouplings. Later on, we will also introduce the pertinent
definitions of energy and momentum variables in the various channels.
The nomenclature we will follow in our labelling is that
of Blaizot and Ripka, see  chapter 15 in Ref.~\citelow{Morten:br86}.
All matrix elements in the definitions below 
are antisymmetrised and unnormalised.
The first channel is the $[12]$ channel, or the $s$-channel
in field theory, and its angular momentum coupling order
is depicted in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:channelsdef}. 
In this figure 
we do not distinguish between particles and holes, all single-particle
labels $1,2,3,4$ can represent either a hole or particle
single-particle state. It is the coupling order which is
of interest here.  
The matrix element $V^{[12]}$ in the $[12]$ channel is then 
\begin{equation}
       V_{1234J}^{[12]}
       =\left\langle (12)J\right | V
       \left | (34)J\right\rangle,
       \label{Morten:eq:12channel}
\end{equation} 
meaning that the single-particle state $1(3)$ couples to the state
$2(4)$ to yield a total angular momentum $J$. 
This channel is commonly denoted as the particle-particle (pp)
or particle-particle-hole-hole (pphh) channel, meaning that when
we will sum classes of diagrams to infinite order in this channel, the only
intermediate states which are allowed are those of a pphh character,
coupled to a final $J$ in the order shown in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:12channel}).
In the next section we will  discuss ways to evaluate
the equations for the $[12]$ channel. 
This coupling order is also the standard way of representing
effective interactions for shell-model
calculations.
If we now specialise to particles and holes (these matrix 
elements were shown in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:wavef1}) we obtain for the case  
with particle states only\footnote{Note that we only 
include angular momentum factors,
other factors associated with a particular diagram
\cite{Morten:kstop81}, like factors originating in the
number of hole lines and number of closed loops, energy denominators,
etc.\ are omitted here.}, diagram (a),
\begin{equation}
      V_{\mathrm{2p}}=V_{pqrs J}^{[12]}=
       \left\langle (pq)J\right | V\left | (rs)J\right\rangle.
       \label{Morten:eq:2pv}
\end{equation}
The corresponding one for holes only, diagram (b), is
\begin{equation}
      V_{\mathrm{2h}}=V_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta J}^{[12]}=
       \left\langle (\alpha\beta)J\right | V
       \left | (\gamma\delta)J\right\rangle.
       \label{Morten:eq:2hv}
\end{equation}
Thus, in the forthcoming discussion, we will always employ as our
basic notation for a matrix element that of the $[12]$ channel,
meaning that matrix elements of the other two channels can always be
rewritten in terms of those in $[12]$ channel We see this immediately
by looking at the expression for the matrix element in the $[13]$
channel, the $t$-channel in field theory, see
Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:channelsdef}(b). Here the single-particle state
$3(4)$ couples to the single-particle state $1(2)$\footnote{In the 
angular momentum representation, the
coupling direction in a diagram 
will always be from incoming single-particle states
to outgoing single-particle states.}.  Through simple angular momentum
algebra we have
\begin{equation}
      V_{1234J}^{[13]}=
      {\displaystyle \sum_{J'}}(-)^{j_1+j_4+J+J'}\hat{J'}^2
      \left\{
      \begin{array}{ccc}
       j_3&j_1&J\\j_2&j_4&J'
      \end{array}
       \right\}V_{1234J}^{[12]},
       \label{Morten:eq:13channel}
\end{equation}
where the symbol with curly brackets represents a $6j$-symbol and
$\hat{J'}=\sqrt{2J'+1}$.
In a similar way we can also express the matrix
element in the $[14]$ channel, the $u$-channel in field theory,
through  
\begin{equation}
       V_{1234J}^{[14]}=
      {\displaystyle \sum_{J'}}(-)^{j_1+j_4+J+2j_3}\hat{J'}^2
      \left\{
      \begin{array}{ccc}
       j_4&j_1&J\\j_2&j_3&J'
      \end{array}
       \right\}
       V_{1234J}^{[12]}.
       \label{Morten:eq:14channel}
\end{equation}
It is also possible to have the inverse relations or to express
e.g., the $[14]$ channel through the $[13]$ channel as
\begin{equation}
       V_{1234J}^{[14]}=
      {\displaystyle \sum_{J'}}(-)^{2j_1+2j_2+2j_3}\hat{J'}^2
      \left\{
      \begin{array}{ccc}
       j_4&j_1&J\\j_3&j_2&J'
      \end{array}
       \right\}
       V_{1234J}^{[13]}.
       \label{Morten:eq:1413channel}
\end{equation}
The matrix elements defined in 
Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:12channel})-(\ref{Morten:eq:1413channel}) 
and the inverse relations are the 
starting points for various resummation of diagrams.
In the next section we will detail ways of solving equations
in the $[12]$ channel, whereas various approximations for the 
$[13]$ channel and $[14]$ channel such as the TDA and RPA 
and  vertex and propagator renormalisation schemes 
will be discussed in section \ref{Morten:sec:sec4}. Finally, how to
merge self-consistently  all three channels will be discussed
in section \ref{Morten:sec:sec5}.

We end this section by giving the expressions in an angular momentum
basis for the remaining 
diagrams of Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:wavef1}. The coupling order is indicated
in the same figure. 

Thus, the 2p1h vertex $V_{\mathrm{2p1h}}$, 
diagram (c) in  Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:wavef1}, 
is coupled
following the prescription for the $[13]$ channel and reads
\begin{equation}
      V_{\mathrm{2p1h}}=V_{pqr\alpha J}^{[13]}=
      {\displaystyle \sum_{J'}}(-)^{j_{\alpha}+j_p+J+J'}\hat{J'}^2
      \left\{
      \begin{array}{ccc}
       j_r&j_p&J\\j_q&j_{\alpha}&J'
      \end{array}
       \right\}
       V_{pqr\alpha J'}^{[12]}.
       \label{Morten:eq:2p1hv}
\end{equation}
The 2p2h ground-state correlation $V_{\mathrm{2p2h}}$, diagram (d),
 which will enter
in the RPA summation discussed in Sec.~\ref{Morten:sec:sec4} is given by,
the coupling order is that of the $[13]$ channel, 
\begin{equation}
      V_{\mathrm{2p2h}}=V_{pq\alpha\beta J}^{[13]}=
      {\displaystyle \sum_{J'}}(-)^{j_{\beta}+j_p+J+J'}\hat{J'}^2
      \left\{
      \begin{array}{ccc}
       j_{\alpha}&j_p&J\\j_q&j_{\beta}&J'
      \end{array}
       \right\}
       V_{pq\alpha\beta J'}^{[12]}.
       \label{Morten:eq:2p2hv}
\end{equation}
The 2h1p vertex $V_{\mathrm{2h1p}}$, diagram (e), 
still in the representation of 
the $[13]$ channel, is defined as
\begin{equation}
      V_{\mathrm{2h1p}}=V_{\alpha\beta\gamma p J}^{[13]}=
      {\displaystyle \sum_{J'}}(-)^{j_{\alpha}+j_p+J+J'}\hat{J'}^2
      \left\{
      \begin{array}{ccc}
       j_{\gamma}&j_{\alpha}&J\\j_{\beta}&j_p&J'
      \end{array}
       \right\}
       V_{\alpha\beta\gamma p J'}^{[12]}.
       \label{Morten:eq:2h1pv}
\end{equation}
Note well that the vertices of Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:2p1hv})-(\ref{Morten:eq:2h1pv})
and their respective 
hermitian conjugates can all be expressed in the $[14]$ channel
or $[12]$ channel as well.
However, it is important to note that the expressions in the various
channels are different, and when solving the equations for the various 
channels, the renormalisations will be different. As an example, consider
the two particle-hole vertices $V_{\mathrm{ph}}$ 
of Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:wavef1}, i.e., diagrams (f) and (g).
Diagram (g) is just the exchange diagram of (f) when seen in the 
$[12]$ channel. However, if (f) is coupled as in the $[13]$ channel,
recoupling this diagram to the $[14]$ channel will not give 
two particle-hole
two-body states coupled to a final $J$ but rather 
a particle-particle two-body state and a hole-hole  two-body state.
But why bother at all about such petty details? The problem arises when we 
are to  sum diagrams in the $[13]$ channel and $[14]$ channel.  
In the $[12]$ channel we allow only particle-particle and hole-hole
intermediate states, whereas in the $[13]$ channel and $[14]$ channel
we allow only particle-hole intermediate states, else we may risk
to double-count various contributions. 
If we therefore recouple
diagram (f) to the $[14]$ representation, this contribution
does not yield an intermediate particle-hole state
in the $[14]$ channel.
Thus, diagram (f), whose expression is 
\begin{equation}
      V_{\mathrm{ph}}=V_{p\beta \alpha q J}^{[13]}=
      {\displaystyle \sum_{J'}}(-)^{j_p+j_q+J+J'}\hat{J'}^2
      \left\{
      \begin{array}{ccc}
       j_{\alpha}&j_p&J\\j_{\beta}&j_q&J'
      \end{array}
       \right\}
       V_{p\beta \alpha q J'}^{[12]},
       \label{Morten:eq:ph13}
\end{equation}
yields a particle-hole contribution only in the $[13]$ channel,
whereas the exchange diagram (g), which reads
\begin{equation}
      V_{\mathrm{ph}}=V_{p\beta q\alpha J}^{[14]}=
      {\displaystyle \sum_{J'}}(-)^{2j_q+j_{\alpha}+j_p+J}\hat{J'}^2
      \left\{
      \begin{array}{ccc}
       j_{\alpha}&j_p&J\\j_{\beta}&j_{q}&J'
      \end{array}
       \right\}
       V_{p\beta q\alpha J'}^{[12]},
       \label{Morten:eq:ph14}
\end{equation}
results in the corresponding particle-hole contribution in the 
$[14]$ channel.
In electron gas theory, the latter expression 
\index{electron gas} 
is often identified as the starting point for the self-screening 
\index{self screening}
of the exchange term. 
\index{exchange}
In the discussion of the TDA series in 
section \ref{Morten:sec:sec4} we will give the expressions for the screening
corrections based on Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:ph13}) and (\ref{Morten:eq:ph14}). 

An important aspect to notice in connection with the latter
equations and the discussions in  sections \ref{Morten:sec:sec4}
and \ref{Morten:sec:sec5} is that 
\begin{equation} 
    V_{p\beta q\alpha J}^{[14]}=-V_{p\beta \alpha q J}^{[13]},
\end{equation}
i.e., just the exchange diagram, as it should be.
However, it is important to keep this in mind, since later we
will sum  sets of diagrams in the
$[13]$ channel and the $[14]$ channel, implying thereby that
we will obtain screening and vertex corrections
\index{screening corrections}\index{vertex corrections}
for  both direct and exchange  diagrams. 

\section{Summation of diagrams in the $[12]$ channel}
\label{Morten:sec:sec3}


In order to write down the equation for the renormalised 
interaction $\Gamma^{[12]}$ in the 
$[12]$ channel we first need to present some further definitions.
We will also assume that the reader has some familiarity with the theory 
of Green's functions. Thorough discussions of such topics
can be found in the recent reviews of Dickhoff and M\"uther \cite{Morten:dm92}
and Kuo and Tzeng \cite{Morten:kt94}. In our presentation below we will
borrow from these works and the monograph by Blaizot and Ripka \cite{Morten:br86}.
The vertex $\Gamma^{[12]}$ is in lowest order identical with the 
interaction $V^{[12]}$ and obeys the same symmetry relations
as $V$, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
     \Gamma^{[12]}_{1234J}=\Gamma^{[12]}_{2143J}=-\Gamma^{[12]}_{2134J}=
     \Gamma^{[12]}_{1243J}.
     \label{Morten:eq:symproperties}
\end{equation}
We also need to define energy variables. Since we are going to replace
the interaction $V$ with the $G$ matrix, or certain 
\index{G matrix@$G$ matrix}
approximations to it, as defined in the remainder of tihs chapter, the
momentum variables are already accounted for in $G$. The basis will be
that of harmonic oscillator wave functions, and the labels $1234$ will
hence refer to oscillator quantum numbers, which in turn can be
related to the momentum variables. The labels $1234$, in addition to
representing single-particle quantum numbers, define also the energy
of the single-particle states. With a harmonic oscillator basis, the
starting point for the single-particle energies
$\varepsilon_{1,2,3,4}$ are the unperturbed oscillator energies. When
iterating the equations for $\Gamma^{[12]}$, self-consistent
single-particle energies can be introduced.
\index{single-particle energies!self-consistent}
The total energy in the $[12]$ channel $s$ is
\begin{equation}
    s=\varepsilon_1+\varepsilon_2=\varepsilon_3+\varepsilon_4.
    \label{Morten:eq:energy12}
\end{equation}
The equation for the vertex $\Gamma^{[12]}$ is,
in a compact matrix notation, given by \cite{Morten:br86}
\begin{equation}
     \Gamma^{[12]}=V^{[12]}+V^{[12]}(gg)\Gamma^{[12]},
     \label{Morten:eq:schematic12}
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the one-body Green's function representing 
the intermediate states. 
The diagrammatic expression for this equation is
given in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:selfcons12}. 
\begin{figure}[tbh]

               represents the self-energy $\Sigma$.}
      \label{Morten:fig:selfcons12}
\end{figure}
The expression of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:schematic12}) is known as the
Feynman-Galitskii equation. This equation is normally solved
iteratively.  In the first iteration the irreducible vertex $V^{[12]}$
is then often chosen as the bare $NN$ interaction. This interaction is
then typically assumed to be energy independent and we can drop the
$s$ dependence of $V^{[12]}$. Moreover, the single-particle
propagators are chosen as the unperturbed ones. The first iteration of
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:schematic12}) can then be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
      \Gamma^{[12]}_{1234J}(s) = 
      V^{[12]}_{1234J}+\frac{1}{2}
      \sum_{56}
      V^{[12]}_{1256J}\hat{{\cal G}}^{[12]}
      \Gamma^{[12]}_{5634J}(s),
      \label{Morten:eq:first12}
\end{equation}
with the unperturbed particle-particle and hole-hole propagators 
\begin{equation}
    \hat{{\cal G}}^{[12]}=
    \frac{Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}}{s-\varepsilon_5-\varepsilon_6+\imath \eta}-
    \frac{Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{hh}}}{s-\varepsilon_5-\varepsilon_6-\imath \eta},
    \label{Morten:eq:paulioperator12}
\end{equation}
which results from the integration over the energy variable in the
product of the two single-particle propagators in
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:schematic12}).  The factor $1/2$ follows from one
of the standard rules for Goldstone or Feynman  
diagrams
\cite{Morten:kstop81}, which state that a factor $1/2$ should be
associated with each pair of lines which starts at the same
interaction vertex and ends at the same interaction vertex.  The
reader should note that the intermediate states labelled by the
indices $56$ can be either a two-particle state or a two-hole state.
In Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator12}) we have assumed unperturbed
single-particle energies.  In our iterations we will approximate the
single-particle energies with their real part only. Thus, the
two-particle propagator $\hat{{\cal G}}^{[12]}$ with renormalised
single-particle energies has the same form as the unperturbed one.
The operators $Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}$ and $Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{hh}}$
ensure that the intermediate states are of two-particle or two-hole
character.  In order to obtain a self-consistent scheme,
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}) has also to be accompanied with the
equation for the single-particle propagators $g$ given by Dyson's
equation
\begin{equation}
    g=g_0-g_0\Sigma g,
    \label{Morten:eq:dyson12}
\end{equation}
with $g_0$ being the unperturbed single-particle 
propagator and $\Sigma$ the self-energy. We will however defer a discussion
of these quantities to section \ref{Morten:sec:sec5}. Here it will suffice to state
that  the self-energy is related to the vertex 
$\Gamma^{[12]}$ as 
\begin{equation}
      \Sigma \sim g\Gamma.
      \label{Morten:eq:sigma12}
\end{equation}
The similarity sign is meant to indicate that, although being formally
correct, great care has to be exercised in order not to double-count
contributions to the self-energy \cite{Morten:jls82}.  The set of
equations for the vertex function and the self-energy is shown
pictorially in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:selfcons12}.  Assume now that we
have performed the first iteration. The question which now arises is
whether the vertex $\Gamma^{[12]}$ obtained from the solution of
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}) should replace the bare vertex
$V^{[12]}$ in the next iteration. Before answering this question, let
us give some examples of diagrams which can be generated from the
first iteration.
\begin{figure}[tbh]
%      \setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}

      \caption{Diagrams (a)-(d) give examples of 
               diagrams which are summed up by  
               the use of Eq.~(\protect{\ref{Morten:eq:schematic12}}).
               Diagrams (e) and (f) are examples of core-polarisation
               terms which are not generated by the $[12]$ channel.}
      \label{Morten:fig:gamma12}
\end{figure}
These are given by diagrams (a)-(d) in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:gamma12}.
Diagrams (a) and (b) are examples of contributions to second order in
perturbation theory, while diagrams (c) and (d) are higher order
terms. Diagrams (e) and (f) are higher-order core-polarisation terms,
which can, e.g., be generated through the solution of the equations for
the $[13]$ and $[14]$ channels discussed in the next section.  If we
were to include diagrams (a)-(d) in the definition of the bare vertex
in our next iteration, we are prone to double-count, since such
contributions are generated once again. Diagrams which contain
particle-hole intermediate state are however not generated by the
solution of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}).  We need therefore to
define the vertex $V^{[12]}$ used in every iteration to be the sum of
diagrams which are irreducible in the $[12]$ channel.  With
irreducible we will mean all diagrams which cannot be reduced to a
piece containing the particle states $12$ entering or leaving the same
interaction vertex and another part containing the states $34$ at the
same interaction vertex by cutting two internal lines.  Clearly, if we
cut diagrams (a) and (b) we are just left with two bare interaction
vertices. Similarly, cutting two lines of an intermediate state in
diagrams (c) and (d) leaves us with two second-order terms of the type
(a) and (b) and one bare interaction.  Diagrams (e) and (f) are
however examples of diagrams which are irreducible in the $[12]$
channel. Diagram (e) is irreducible in the $[13]$ channel, but not in
the $[14]$ channel.  Similarly, diagram (f) is reducible in the $[13]$
channel and irreducible in the $[14]$ channel.  This means that,
unless we solve equations similar to Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}) in
the $[13]$ channel and $[14]$ channels as well, changes from further
iterations of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}) will only come from the
single-particle terms defined by Dyson's equation in
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:dyson12}). \index{Dyson's equation}

In the remaining part of this section, we will try to delineate ways 
of solving the above equations, and discuss possible approximations,
their merits and faults. First of all, we will reduce
the propagator of  Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator12}) to only include
particle-particle intermediate states. This will lead us to the familiar
$G$ matrix in nuclear many-body theory. 
Based on the $G$ matrix, we will construct effective interactions
through perturbative summations. Applications of such 
effective interactions to selected nuclei will then be discussed.
Thereafter, we will try to
account for hole-hole contributions and end this section with a 
discussion on self-consistent determinations of the single-particle 
energies through the solution of Dyson's equation.
 

\index{G matrix@$G$ matrix|(}

\subsection{The $G$ matrix}

In nuclear structure and nuclear matter calculations one has to
face the problem that any realistic $NN$ interaction $V$
exhibits a strong short-range repulsion, 
\index{nuclear interaction!short-range repulsion}
\index{short-range repulsion}
which in turn makes a perturbative treatment of the nuclear many-body
problem prohibitive. If the interaction has a so-called hard core, the
matrix elements of such an interaction $\bra{\phi}V\ket{\phi}$
evaluated for an uncorrelated two-body wave function $\phi (r)$
diverge, since the uncorrelated wave function is different from zero
also for relative distances $r$ smaller than the hard-core
radius. Similarly, even if one uses interactions with softer cores,
the matrix elements of the interaction become very large at short
distances.  The above problem was however overcome by introducing the
reaction matrix $G^{[12]}$ \index{reaction matrix $G$}
(obtained by the summation of the ladder-type
diagrams as in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:gamma12}a,c with particle-particle
intermediate states only), accounting thereby for short-range
two-nucleon correlations.  The $G^{[12]}$-matrix represents just a
subset to the solution of the equations for the interaction
$\Gamma^{[12]}$ in the $[12]$ channel, we have clearly neglected the
possibility of having intermediate states which are of the hole-hole
type.  The matrix elements of the interaction $V^{[12]}$ then becomes
\begin{equation}
\bra{\phi}G^{[12]}\ket{\phi} =\bra{\phi}V^{[12]}\ket{\Psi}
\end{equation}
where $\Psi$ is now the correlated wave function
containing selected correlation from the excluded space.
By accounting for these
correlations in the two-body wave function $\Psi$, the matrix elements of
the interaction become finite, even for a hard-core interaction $V$. Moreover,
as will be discussed below, compared with the uncorrelated
wave function, the correlated wave function enhances the
matrix elements of $V$ at distances for which the interaction is
attractive.
The type of correlations which  are included in the evaluation
of the $G^{[12]}$-matrix are those of two-particle type.
If we label the operator $Q$ in this case by $Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}$, we can write
the integral equation for the $G$ matrix as 
\index{G matrix@$G$ matrix!integral equation for}
\begin{equation}
   G^{[12]}(s)=V^{[12]}+V^{[12]}\frac{Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}}
           {s -H_0+\imath \eta}G^{[12]}(s),
   \label{Morten:eq:g1}
\end{equation}
implicitly assuming that $\lim \eta \rightarrow 0^+$. 
The variable $s$ represents the unperturbed 
energy of the incoming two-particle state. We will suppress $\imath \eta$ in the 
following equations. Moreover, since one is often only  interested in the 
$G^{[12]}$-matrix
for negative starting energies, the $G^{[12]}$-matrix commonly used in studies
of effective interactions has no divergencies.

We can also write  
\begin{equation}
      G^{[12]}(s )=V^{[12]}+V^{[12]}Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}
      \frac{1}{s -Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}H_0Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}}
      Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}
      G^{[12]}(s ).
      \label{Morten:eq:g2}
\end{equation}
The former equation applies if the Pauli operator 
\index{Pauli operator}
$Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}$  commutes
with the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0$, whereas the latter is
needed if $[H_0,Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}]\neq 0$.
Similarly, the correlated wave function $\Psi$
is given as
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\Psi}=\ket{\phi}+
    \frac{Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}}{s - H_0}G^{[12]}\ket{\phi},
    \label{Morten:eq:wave}
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
   \ket{\Psi}=\ket{\phi}+Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}\frac{1}
    {s - Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}H_0Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}}
    Q^{[12]}_{\mathrm{pp}}G^{[12]}\ket{\phi}.
\end{equation}


In order to evaluate the $G^{[12]}$-matrix for finite nuclei,
we define first a useful identity following Bethe, Brandow and
Petschek \cite{Morten:bbp63}. Suppose we have two
different $G$-matrices\footnote{For notational economy, 
we drop the superscript $^{[12]}$. Furthermore, 
in the subsequent discussion in 
this subsection it is understood that all operators $Q$ 
refer to particle-particle intermediate states only. The subscript
$\mathrm{pp}$ is thus also suppressed.}, defined by
\begin{equation}
    G_1=V_1+V_1\frac{Q_1}{e_1}G_1,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    G_2=V_2+V_2\frac{Q_2}{e_2}G_2,
\end{equation}
where $Q_1/e_1$ and $Q_2/e_2$ are the propagators of
either Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:g1}) or Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:g2}). $G_1$ and $G_2$
are two different $G$-matrices having two different interactions
and/or different propagators. We aim at an identity
which will enable us to calculate $G_1$ in terms of $G_2$,
or vice versa.
Defining the wave operators
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_1=1+\frac{Q_1}{e_1}G_1,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_2=1+\frac{Q_2}{e_2}G_2,
\end{equation}
we can rewrite the above $G$-matrices as
\begin{equation}
    G_1=V_1\Omega_1,
    \label{Morten:eq:omega1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    G_2=V_2\Omega_2.
    \label{Morten:eq:omega2}
\end{equation}
Using these relations, we rewrite $G_1$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
   G_1=&G_1 -{\displaystyle 
         G_2^{\dagger}\left(\Omega_1-1-\frac{Q_1}{e_1}G_1\right)
        +\left(\Omega_2^{\dagger}-1-G_2^{\dagger}\frac{Q_2}{e_2}\right)G_1} 
         \nonumber \\
       =&{\displaystyle G_2^{\dagger} +G_2^{\dagger}\left(\frac{Q_1}{e_1}-
        \frac{Q_2}{e_2}\right)G_1
        +\Omega_2^{\dagger}G_1 -G_2^{\dagger}\Omega_1} ,
\end{eqnarray}
and from Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:omega1}) and (\ref{Morten:eq:omega2}) we obtain
the identity
\begin{equation}
        G_1=G_2^{\dagger} +G_2^{\dagger}
        \left(\frac{Q_1}{e_1}-\frac{Q_2}{e_2}\right)G_1
        +\Omega_2^{\dagger}(V_1-V_2)\Omega_1.
        \label{Morten:eq:gidentity}
\end{equation}
The second term on the right-hand side is called the
propagator-correction term; 
\index{propagator-correction term}
it vanishes if $G_1$ and $G_2$ have the
same propagators. The third term is often referred to as the
potential-correction term, 
\index{potential-correction term}
and it disappears if $G_1$ and $G_2$ have
the same potentials.
The reader may now ask what is the advantage of the above identity. If
we assume that by some physical reasoning we are able to calculate
$G_2$ and that the expression for $G_2$ can be calculated
easily, and further that $G_2$ is a good approximation
to the original $G$ matrix, then we can use the above identity to
perform a perturbative calculation of $G_1$ in terms of $G_2$.

Before we proceed in detailing the calculation of the $G$ matrix
appropriate for finite nuclei, certain approximations need be explained.
As discussed above, the philosophy behind perturbation theory is
to reduce the intractable full Hilbert space problem to one which
can be solved within a physically motivated model space, defined by the
operator $P$. The excluded degrees of freedom are represented by the
projection operator $Q$. The definition of these operators is connected
with the nuclear system and the perturbative expansions discussed
in section \ref{Morten:sec:sec2}. Consider the evaluation of the effective interaction
needed in calculations of the low-lying states of $^{18}$O.
\index{018O@$^{18}O$}
From experimental data and theoretical calculations it is concluded
that several properties of this nucleus can be described by a model
space consisting of a closed $^{16}$O core (consisting of the filled
$0s$- and $0p$-shells) and two valence neutrons in the $1s0d$-shell.
In Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:orbits} we exhibit this division in terms of
HO single-particle orbits.  The active single-particle states in the $1s0d$-shell are then given
by the $0d_{5/2}$, $0d_{3/2}$ and $1s_{1/2}$ orbits, containing shells
numbered $4-6$ in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:orbits}.  The remaining states
enter the definition of $Q$. Once we have defined $P$ and $Q$ we
proceed in constructing the $G$ matrix and the corresponding
perturbative expansion in terms of the $G$ matrix.  However, there are
several ways of choosing $Q$. A common procedure is to specify the
boundaries of $Q$ by three numbers, $n_1$, $n_2$ and $n_3$, explained
in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:qoperat}.

\begin{figure}%[tbh]
%      \setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}

\label{Morten:fig:qoperat}
\end{figure}


For $^{18}$O we would choose $(n_1=3,n_2=6,n_3=\infty)$. 
Our choice of 
$P$-space implies that the single-particle states outside the model space
start from the
$1p0f$-shell (numbers 7--10 in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:orbits}), and orbits 1, 2
and 3 are hole states. Stated differently, this means that $Q$
is constructed so as to prevent scattering into intermediate 
two-particle states 
with one particle in the $0s$- or $0p$-shells or both particles
in the $1s0d$-shell. This definition of the $Q$-space influences the determination
of the effective shell-model interaction. Consider the diagrams displayed
in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:qboxexam1}.
Diagram (a) of this figure is just the $G$ matrix and is allowed in the definition
of the $\hat{Q}$ box. With our choice $(n_1=3,n_2=6,n_3=\infty)$, diagram (b) is not
allowed since the intermediate state consists of passive particle
states  and is already included in the evaluation of the $G$ matrix. Similarly,
diagram (c) is also not allowed whereas diagram (d) is allowed. Now an important
subtlety arises. If we evaluate the $G$ matrix with the boundaries
$(n_1=3,n_2=10,n_3=\infty)$, and define the $P$-space of {\em 
the effective interaction}
by including orbits 4 to 6 only, then diagrams (b) and (c)
are allowed if $7\leq p_1 , p_2 \leq 10$.
In this way we allow for 
intermediate two-particle states as well with orbits outside the 
model-space of the effective interaction. The reader should notice the above
differences, i.e., that the $Q$-space defining the $G$ matrix and 
$H_{\mathrm{eff}}$
may differ.

\end{figure}


In order to calculate the $G$ matrix we will henceforth employ a 
so-called double-partitioned scheme. 
\index{G matrix@$G$ matrix!calculation!double-partitioned scheme}
Let us be more specific and discuss this double-partitioned procedure
in more detail.  We define first a reference $G$ matrix $\tilde{G}$ in
terms of plane wave intermediate states only, meaning that $H_0$ is
\index{G matrix@$G$ matrix!plane wave}
replaced by the kinetic energy operator $T$ only while $G$ has
harmonic oscillator intermediate states (this is one possible choice
for $U$). We divide the exclusion operator into two parts, one which
represents the low-lying states $Q_l$ and one which accounts for
high-lying states $Q_h$, viz.
\[
    Q=Q_l+Q_h=Q_l+\tilde{Q}.
\]
If we consider $^{18}$O as our pilot nucleus, we may define $Q_l$ to
consist of the single-particle orbits of the $1p0f$-shell, orbits $7-10$ in
Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:orbits}, described by HO states. $Q_h$
represents then the remaining orthogonalised intermediate states.
Using the identity of Bethe, Brandow and Petschek \cite{Morten:bbp63}
of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:gidentity}) we can first set up $\tilde{G}$ as
\begin{equation}
     \tilde{G}=V+V\frac{\tilde{Q}}{s -T}\tilde{G},
\label{Morten:eq:gfinite}
\end{equation}
and  express $G$ in terms of $\tilde{G}$ as
\begin{equation}
        G=\tilde{G} +\tilde{G}
        \left(\frac{Q_l}{s -H_0}\right)G,
        \label{Morten:eq:gidfinite}
\end{equation}
and we have assumed that $\tilde{G}$ is hermitian and that $[Q_l,H_0]=0$.
Thus, we first calculate
a ``reference'' $G$ matrix ($\tilde{G}$ in our case), and then insert this
in the expression for the full $G$ matrix. The novelty here is that
we are able to calculate $\tilde{G}$ exactly through operator relations
to be discussed below. In passing we note that $G$ depends significantly 
on the choice of $H_0$, though the low-lying intermediate states
are believed to be fairly well represented by HO states. 
Also, the authors of Ref.~\citelow{Morten:kkko76} demonstrate that low-lying
intermediate states are not so important in $G$ matrix calculations,
being consistent with the short-range nature of the $NN$ interaction.
Since we let $Q_l$ to be defined by the orbits of the $1p0f$-shell,
and the energy difference between two particles in the 
$sd$-shell and $pf$ shell is of the order $-14$ MeV, we can treat 
$G$ as a perturbation expansion in $\tilde{G}$.
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:gidfinite}) can then be written as 
\begin{equation}
        G=\tilde{G} +\tilde{G}
        \left(\frac{Q_l}{s -H_0}\right)\tilde{G}
        +\tilde{G}
        \left(\frac{Q_l}{s -H_0}\right)\tilde{G}
        \left(\frac{Q_l}{s -H_0}\right)\tilde{G} +\dots
\end{equation}
The only intermediate states are those defined by the $1p0f$-shell.
The second term on the right-hand side is nothing but the second-order 
particle-particle ladder. The third term is then the third-order ladder
diagram in terms of
$\tilde{G}$. As shown by the authors of Ref.~\citelow{Morten:kkko76}, the inclusion
of the second-order particle-particle diagram in the evaluation
of the $\hat{Q}$ box, represents a good approximation. 
We still need to settle the  problem how to define the boundary between 
$Q_l$ and $Q_h$. 

Now we will discuss how to compute $\tilde{G}$. 
\index{G matrix@$G$ matrix!solution for finite nuclei}
One can solve the equation for the $G$ matrix
for finite nuclei by employing
a formally
exact technique for handling $\tilde{Q}$
discussed in e.g., Ref.~\citelow{Morten:kkko76}.
Using the matrix identity
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{Q}\frac{1}{\tilde{Q}A\tilde{Q}}
  \tilde{Q}=\frac{1}{A}-
   \frac{1}{A}\tilde{P}\frac{1}{\tilde{P}A^{-1}\tilde{P}}\tilde{P}\frac{1}{A},
   \label{Morten:eq:matrix_relation_q}
\end{equation}
with $A=s -T$, to rewrite Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:gfinite}) 
as\footnote{We will omit the
label $\tilde{G}$ for the $G$ matrix for finite nuclei. Nonetheless
 the $G$ matrix for finite nuclei is calculated according
to Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:gfinite}). This means that we have to 
include the particle-particle ladder diagrams in the 
$\hat{Q}$ box. }
\begin{equation}
   G = G_{F} +\Delta G,\label{Morten:eq:gmod}
\end{equation}
where $G_{F}$ is the free $G$ matrix defined as
\begin{equation}
   G_{F}=V+V\frac{1}{s - T}G_{F}. \label{Morten:eq:freeg}
\end{equation}
The term $\Delta G$ is a correction term defined entirely within the
model space $\tilde{P}$ and given by
\begin{equation}
   \Delta G =-V\frac{1}{A}\tilde{P}
   \frac{1}{\tilde{P}A^{-1}\tilde{P}}\tilde{P}\frac{1}{A}V.
\end{equation}
Employing the definition for the free $G$ matrix of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:freeg}),
one can rewrite the latter equation as
\begin{equation}
  \Delta G =-G_{F}\frac{1}{e}\tilde{P}
  \frac{1}{\tilde{P}(e^{-1}+e^{-1}G_{F}e^{-1})
  \tilde{P}}\tilde{P}\frac{1}{e}G_F,
\end{equation}
with $e=s -T$.  We see then that the $G$ matrix for finite nuclei is
expressed as the sum of two terms; the first term is the free $G$
matrix with no Pauli corrections included, while the second term
accounts for medium modifications due to the Pauli principle. The
second term can easily be obtained by some simple matrix operations
involving the model-space matrix $\tilde{P}$ only.  However, the
second term is a function of the variable $n_3$. The convergence in
terms of $n_3$ was discussed \emph{in extenso} in
Ref.~\citelow{Morten:hko95} and we refer the reader to that work.  The
equation for the free matrix $G_F$ is solved in momentum space in
relative and centre-of-mass (CM) variables and is then
transformed to an expression in terms of harmonic oscillator
single-particle wavefunctions in the laboratory system. This finally
yields matrix elements of the type
\begin{equation}
  \bra{(ab)J}G\ket{(cd)J}
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the given by the sum $G = G_{F} +\Delta G$.
The label $a$ represents here all the single particle quantum numbers
$a\equiv n_{a}l_{a}j_{a}$.

\subsection{Folded diagrams and the effective valence space interaction}

Here we discuss further classes of diagrams
which can be included in the evaluation of effective interactions
for the shell model.
Especially, we will focus on the summations of so-called folded
diagrams.

One way of obtaining the wave operator 
$\Omega$ is through the generalised Bloch
equation 
\index{Bloch equation!generalised}
given by Lindgren and Morrison \cite{Morten:lm85}
\begin{equation}
[\Omega, H_0]P=QH_1\Omega P-\chi PH_1\Omega P,
\label{Morten:eq:lind}
\end{equation}
which offers a suitable way of generating the RS perturbation expansion.
Writing Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:lind}) in terms of $\Omega^{(n)}$ we have
\begin{equation}
[\Omega^{(1)}, H_0]P=QH_1P,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
[\Omega^{(2)}, H_0]P=QH_1\Omega^{(1)} P- \Omega^{(1)} PH_1P,
\end{equation}
and so forth,  which can be generalised to
\begin{equation}
[\Omega^{(n)}, H_0]P=QH_1\Omega^{(n-1)} P- \sum_{m=1}^{n-1}
\Omega^{(n-m)} PH_1\Omega^{(m-1)}P.
\end{equation}
The effective interaction to a given order can then be obtained from
$\Omega^{(n)}$, see Ref.~\citelow{Morten:lm85}.
Another possibility is the coupled-cluster method discussed
in chapters \ref{chap:CCM,chap:Jesus}.

Here we will assume that we can start with a given
approximation to $\Omega$, and through an iterative scheme generate
higher order terms. Such schemes will in general differ from the
order-by-order scheme of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:lind}).  Two such iterative
schemes were derived  by Lee and Suzuki \cite{Morten:ls80}. We will focus
on the folded diagram method of Kuo and co-workers \cite{Morten:ko90}.

Having defined the wave operator $\Omega = 1 +\chi$ (note that $
\Omega^{-1}=1-\chi$) with
$\chi$ given by Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:chi2}) we can obtain
\begin{equation}
     QHP-\chi HP +QH\chi - \chi H\chi = 0. \label{Morten:eq:basic}
\end{equation}
This is the basic equation to which a solution to $\chi$ is
to be sought.
If we choose to  work with a degenerate model space we define
\[
   PH_0 P = s P,
\]
where $s$ is the unperturbed model space eigenvalue
(or starting energy) in the degenerate case,
such that Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:basic}) reads in a slightly modified form
($H=H_0 + H_1$)
\[
    (s -QH_0 Q -QH_1 Q)\chi = QH_1 P -\chi PH_1 P -\chi PH_1 Q\chi,
\]
which yields the following equation for $\chi$
\begin{equation}
    \chi = \frac{1}{s - QHQ}QH_1 P -\frac{1}{s -QHQ}\chi\left(PH_1 P +
    PH_1 Q\chi P\right).\label{Morten:eq:chi3}
\end{equation}
Observing that  the $P$-space effective Hamiltonian is given as
\[
     H_{\mathrm{eff}}= PHP+PH\chi=PH_0 P + V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\chi),
\]
with $V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\chi)= PH_1 P + PH_1Q\chi P$, Eq. (\ref{Morten:eq:chi3}) becomes
\begin{equation}
     \chi = \frac{1}{s - QHQ}QH_1 P -\frac{1}{s -QHQ}
     \chi V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\chi ).
     \label{Morten:eq:chi4}
\end{equation}
Now we find it convenient to introduce the so-called $\hat{Q}$ box,
\index{Q box@$\hat{Q}$ box}
defined as
\begin{equation}
     \hat{Q}(s)=PH_1 P + PH_1 Q\frac{1}{s - QHQ}
      QH_1 P.\label{Morten:eq:qbox}
\end{equation}
The $\hat{Q}$ box is made up of non-folded diagrams which are irreducible
\index{diagrams!irreducible}\index{diagrams!valence linked}
and valence linked. A diagram is said to be irreducible if between each pair
of vertices there is at least one hole state or a particle state outside
the model space. In a valence-linked diagram the interactions are linked
(via fermion lines) to at least one valence line. Note that a valence-linked
diagram can be either connected (consisting of a single piece) or
disconnected. In the final expansion which includes folded diagrams, the
disconnected diagrams are found to cancel \cite{Morten:ko90}. 
This corresponds to the cancellation of unlinked diagrams
of the Goldstone expansion.
We illustrate
these definitions by the diagrams shown in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:diagsexam}.
\begin{figure}%[tbh]
%      \setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}
%      \begin{picture}(100,40)

	\begin{center}
      	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{diagsexam.eps}
	\end{center}
\caption{Different types of valence-linked diagrams. Diagram (a)
is irreducible and connected, (b) is reducible, while (c) is irreducible
and disconnected.}
\label{Morten:fig:diagsexam}
\end{figure}
Diagram (a) is irreducible, valence linked and connected, 
while (b) is reducible since 
the intermediate particle states belong to the model space. 
Diagram (c) is irreducible, valence linked and disconnected. 
It is worth noting that general form of the $\hat{Q}$ box
is the same as that of the $G$ matrix, or the equations
of the $[12]$ channel or those of the $[13]$ and $[14]$
channels to be discussed in section \ref{Morten:sec:sec4}.
In Ref.~\citelow{Morten:hko95}, the $\hat{Q}$ box was defined
to be the sum all diagrams to third order in the $G$ matrix.
\index{Q box@$\hat Q$ box!relation to $G$ matrix}


Multiplying both sides of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:chi4}) with $PH_1$ and
adding $PH_1 P$ to both sides we get
\[
    PH_1 P + PH_1 \chi =
    PH_1 P + PH_1 Q\frac{1}{s - QHQ}QH_1 P -
    PH_1 \frac{1}{s -QHQ}\chi V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\chi ),
\]
which gives
\begin{equation}
     V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\chi )=\hat{Q}(s)-
     PH_1 \frac{1}{s -QHQ}\chi V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\chi ).
     \label{Morten:eq:veff}
\end{equation}

There are several ways to solve Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:veff}). The idea is
to set up an iteration scheme where we determine $\chi_n$ and
thus $V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\chi_n )$ from 
$\chi_{n-1}$ and $V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\chi_{n-1})$.
For the mere sake of simplicity we write 
$V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(n)}=V_{\mathrm{eff}}(\chi_{n})$.

Let us write Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:veff}) as
\[
   V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(n)}=\hat{Q}(s)-
   PH_1 \frac{1}{s -QHQ}\chi_n V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(n-1)}.
\]
The solution to this equation can be shown to be \cite{Morten:ls80}
\begin{equation}
    V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(n)}=\hat{Q}+{\displaystyle\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}}
    \frac{1}{m!}\frac{d^m\hat{Q}}{ds^m}\left\{
    V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(n-1)}\right\}^m . 
    \label{Morten:eq:fd}
\end{equation}
Observe also that the
effective interaction is $V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(n)}$ 
is evaluated at a given model space energy
$s$. If
$V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(n)}=V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(n-1)}$, the iteration is said to
converge. In the limiting case $n\rightarrow \infty$, the
solution $V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(\infty)}$ agrees with the formal solution of
Brandow
\cite{Morten:brandow67} and Des Cloizeaux \cite{Morten:des}
\begin{equation}
    V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(\infty)}=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{m!}
    \frac{d^{m}\hat{Q}}{ds^{m}}\left\{
    V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(\infty)}\right\}^{m}.\label{Morten:eq:pert}
\end{equation}



Alternatively, we can generate the contribution
from $n$ folds the following way. In
an $n$-folded $\hat{Q}$ box there are $n+1$ $\hat{Q}$ boxes. The 
\index{Q box@$\hat{Q}$ box!$n$ folded}
general expression for an $n$-folded $\hat{Q}$ box is then
\begin{eqnarray}
\lefteqn{        \hat{Q}   -\hat{Q}\int\hat{Q} 
    +\hat{Q}\int\hat{Q}\int\hat{Q} -\dots}\nonumber\\
\qquad&=&
    {\displaystyle\sum_{m_1m_2\dots m_n}}
    \frac{1}{m_1!}\frac{d^{m_1}\hat{Q}}{ds^{m_1}}P
    \frac{1}{m_2!}\frac{d^{m_2}\hat{Q}}{ds^{m_2}}P
    \dots
    \frac{1}{m_n!}\frac{d^{m_n}\hat{Q}}{ds^{m_n}}P\hat{Q},
\label{Morten:eq:fdfinal}
\end{eqnarray}
where we have the constraints
\[
  m_1+m_2+\dots m_n=n,
\]
\[
m_1\geq 1,
\]
\[
m_2, m_3, \dots m_n \geq 0,
\]
and
\[
m_k \leq n-k+1.
\]
The last restriction follows from the fact that there are only $n-k+1$
$\hat{Q}$ boxes to the right of $k^{\mathrm{th}}$ $\hat{Q}$ box.
Thus, it can at most be differentiated $n-k+1$ times.  We have
inserted the model-space projection operator in the above expression,
in order to emphasise that folded diagrams have only model-space
states as intermediate states between successive $\hat{Q}$
boxes. Therefore, the sum in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:fdfinal}) includes a
sum over all model-space states with the same quantum numbers such as
isospin and total angular momentum. It is understood that the
$\hat{Q}$ box and its derivatives are evaluated at the same starting
energy, which should correspond to the unperturbed energy of the
model-space state.  It is then straightforward to recast
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:fdfinal}) into the form of
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:fd}).

Note that although $\hat{Q}$ and its derivatives contain disconnected
diagrams, such diagrams cancel exactly in each order \cite{Morten:ko90}, thus
yielding a fully connected expansion in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:fd}).
However, in order to achieve this, disconnected diagrams have 
to be included in the definition of the $\hat{Q}$ box. An example
is given by diagram (c) in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:diagsexam}. 
Such a diagram will generate a contribution to 
the first fold $\frac{d\hat{Q}}{ds}\hat{Q}=-\hat{Q}\int\hat{Q} $
which cancels exactly diagram (c) when all time-ordered
contributions to this diagram are accounted for, see Ref.~\citelow{Morten:ko90}
for more details. 
It is moreover important to note in connection with the above 
expansion, that a term like
$F_1= \hat{Q}_1 \hat{Q}$ actually means $P\hat{Q}_1 P\hat{Q}P$ since
the $\hat{Q}$ box is defined in the model space only. Here we have defined
$\hat{Q}_{m}=\frac{1}{m!}\frac{d^{m}\hat{Q}}
{ds^{m}}$.
Due to this structure, only the folded diagrams
contain $P$-space intermediate states.


The folded diagram expansion discussed above yields however
a non-hermitian effective interaction. This may happen even at the 
level of the $G$ matrix, or any of the effective interactions
we will derive in this work, from Parquet theory to
the order-by-order perturbation expansion.

We will therefore end this section with a way to cure
this non-hermiticity. 
A hermitian effective interaction has recently been derived by 
Ellis, Kuo, Suzuki and co-workers \cite{Morten:so95,Morten:so84,Morten:kehlsok93} through the
following steps\footnote{The reader who wishes more details can consult
Refs.~\citelow{Morten:so95,Morten:kehlsok93}.}.  
To obtain a hermitian effective interaction, 
let us define 
a model-space eigenstate
$\left | b_{\lambda}\right\rangle$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$ as
\begin{equation}
     \left | b_{\lambda}\right\rangle=\sum_{\alpha =1}^{D}
     b_{\alpha}^{(\lambda )}\left | \phi_{\alpha}\right\rangle
\end{equation}
and the biorthogonal wave function
\begin{equation}
     \left | \overline{b}_{\lambda}\right\rangle=\sum_{\alpha=1}^{D}
      \overline{b}_{\alpha}^{(\lambda )}
     \left | \overline{\phi}_{\alpha}\right\rangle,
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{equation}
     {\left\langle \overline{b}_{\lambda} | b_{\mu} \right\rangle}=
     \delta_{\lambda\mu}.
\end{equation}
The model-space eigenvalue problem can be written 
in terms of the above non-hermitian effective interaction unperturbed
wave functions
\begin{equation}
     {\displaystyle
     \sum_{\gamma =1}^{D}b_l^{(\lambda )}\left\langle \phi_{\sigma}\right |
     H_0+V+VQ\chi\left | \phi_{\gamma}\right\rangle}  =
     E_{\lambda}b_{\sigma}^{(\lambda )}.
\end{equation}
The exact wave function expressed in terms of the correlation 
operator is
\begin{equation}
      \left | \Psi_{\lambda}\right\rangle=
      ({\bf 1}+\chi)\left | \phi_{\lambda}\right\rangle.
\end{equation}
The part $\chi\left | \phi_{\lambda}\right\rangle$ can be expressed in terms
of the time-development operator or 
using the time-independent formalism as
\begin{equation}
  \chi\left | \phi_{\lambda}\right\rangle=
  \frac{Q}{E_{\lambda}-QHQ}QVP\left | \phi_{\lambda}\right\rangle,
  \label{Morten:eq:newchi}
\end{equation}
where $Q$ is the exclusion operator. Note that this equation is given
in terms of the Brillouin-Wigner perturbation expansion, since
we have the exact energy $E_{\lambda}$ in the denominator.
\index{perturbation theory!Brillouin Wigner}

Using the normalisation condition for the true wave function
we obtain
\begin{equation}
  \left\langle \Psi_{\gamma} |\Psi_{\lambda}\right\rangle
  N_{\lambda}\delta_{\lambda\gamma}=
  \left\langle \phi_{\gamma}\right |({\bf 1} +
   \chi^{\dagger}\chi\left | \phi_{\lambda}\right\rangle,
  \label{Morten:eq:newnorm}
\end{equation}
where we have used the fact that
$\left\langle \phi_{\gamma}\right | 
\chi\left | \phi_{\lambda}\right\rangle=0$. Recalling that the
time-development operator is hermitian we have that $\chi^{\dagger}\chi$ is
also hermitian. We can then define an orthogonal basis $d$ whose eigenvalue
relation is
\begin{equation}
   \sum_{\alpha}\left\langle \phi_{\beta}\right | \chi^{\dagger}
   \chi\left | \phi_{\alpha}
   \right\rangle d_{\alpha}^{\lambda}=\mu^{2}_{\lambda}
   d_{\beta}^{\lambda},
   \label{Morten:eq:newbasis1}
\end{equation}
with eigenvalues greater than $0$.
Using the definition in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:newchi}), we note
that the diagonal element of
\begin{equation}
   \left\langle \phi_{\lambda}\right | \chi^{\dagger}
   \chi\left | \phi_{\lambda}\right\rangle=
   \left\langle \phi_{\lambda}\right | PVQ\frac{1}{(E_{\lambda}-QHQ)^2}QVP
   \left | \phi_{\lambda}\right\rangle,
   \label{Morten:eq:chichi}
\end{equation}
which is nothing but the derivative of the $\hat{Q}$ box, with an additional
minus sign. Thus, noting that if $\gamma\neq\lambda$
\begin{equation}
  \left\langle \Psi_{\gamma} |\Psi_{\lambda}\right\rangle=0=
    \left\langle \phi_{\gamma} |\phi_{\lambda}\right\rangle
   +\left\langle \phi_{\gamma}\right |
    \chi^{\dagger}\chi\left | \phi_{\lambda}\right\rangle,
\end{equation}
we can write $\chi^{\dagger}\chi$
in operator form as
\begin{equation}
   \chi^{\dagger}\chi =-\sum_{\alpha}\left | 
    \overline{\phi}_{\alpha}\right\rangle
   \left\langle \phi_{\alpha}\right | 
    \hat{Q}_1(E_{\alpha})\left | \phi_{\alpha}\right\rangle
   \left\langle \overline{\phi}_{\alpha} \right |
   -\sum_{\alpha\neq\beta}\left | \overline{\phi}_{\alpha}\right\rangle
    \left\langle \phi_{\alpha} |\phi_{\beta}\right\rangle
   \left | \overline{\phi}_{\beta}\right\rangle.
\end{equation}
Using the new basis in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:newbasis1}), we see that
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:newnorm}) allows us to define another
orthogonal basis $h$
\begin{equation}
  h_{\alpha}^{\lambda}=\sqrt{\mu_{\alpha}^2+1}\sum_{\beta}
  d_{\beta}^{\alpha}b_{\beta}^{\lambda}\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{\lambda}}}
  =\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_{\alpha}^2+1}}\sum_{\beta}
  d_{\beta}^{\alpha}\overline{b}_{\beta}^{\lambda}\sqrt{N_{\lambda}},
  \label{Morten:eq:hbasis}
\end{equation}
where we have used the orthogonality properties of the vectors
involved. The vector $h$ was used by the authors of
Ref.~\citelow{Morten:kehlsok93} to obtain a hermitian effective
interaction as
\index{nuclear interaction!effective!hermitian}
\begin{equation}
   \left\langle \phi_{\alpha}\right |
   V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\mathrm{(her)}}\left | \phi_{\beta}\right\rangle=
   \frac{\sqrt{\mu_{\alpha}^2+1}\left\langle \phi_{\alpha} \right |

   {\sqrt{\mu_{\alpha}^2+1}+\sqrt{\mu_{\beta}^2+1} },
   \label{Morten:eq:hermitian}
\end{equation}
where (her) and (nher) stand for hermitian and non-hermitian
respectively. 
This equation is rather simple to compute, since
we can use the folded-diagram method
to obtain the non-hermitian part.
To obtain the total hermitian effective interaction, we have to
add the $H_0$ term. The above equation is manifestly hermitian.
Other discussion of the hermiticity problem can be found
in Refs.~\citelow{Morten:lm85,Morten:arponen97}.
The remaining question is how to evaluate the $\hat{Q}$ box. 
Obviously, we are not in the position where we can evaluate it
exactly, i.e., to include all possible many-body terms.
Rather, we have to truncate somewhere. 
Several possible approaches exist, but all have in common that
there is no clear way which tells us where to stop.
However, as argued by the authors of Ref.~\citelow{Morten:jls82}, there is a
minimal class of diagrams which need to be included 
in order to fulfil certain conditions. This class
of diagrams includes both diagrams which account for short-range
correlations such as the $G$ matrix and long-range
correlations such as those accounted for by various 
core-polarisation terms. 
The importance of such diagrams has been extensively documented
in the literature and examples can be found
in Refs.~\citelow{Morten:hko95,Morten:eo77}. In Ref.~\citelow{Morten:hko95} we included
all core-polarisation contributions to third-order
in the $G$ matrix, in addition to including other diagrams
which account for short-range correlations as well. 

In the next subsection we present results from recent 
large scale shell-model Monte Carlo calculations \cite{Morten:drhklz99}
for light nuclei in the $1s0d$ and $1p0f$ shells based 
on an effective interaction for the two shells.
The effective interaction was derived following the methods
outlined hitherto in this section, taking into account 
the non-hermiticity which arises when dealing 
with more than one major shell.
The closed shell core is $^{16}$O and all diagrams through
second-order where employed in the definition of the
$\hat{Q}$ box. Folded diagrams were calculated using the abovementioned
folded-diagrams method and the interaction was made explicitely
hermitian through Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:hermitian}). A discussion of results
for Sn isotopes will also be given.

\subsubsection{Neutron-rich nuclei in the $1s0d$-$1p0f$ shells}

Studies of extremely neutron-rich nuclei have revealed a number of
intriguing new phenomena.  Two sets of these nuclei that have received
particular attention are those with neutron number $N$ in the vicinity
of the $1s0d$ and $0f_{7/2}$ shell closures ($N \approx 20$ and $N
\approx 28$).  Experimental studies of neutron-rich Mg and Na isotopes
\index{neutron-rich isotopes!Mg}
\index{neutron-rich isotopes!Na}
indicate the onset of deformation, as well as the modification of the
$N = 20$ shell gap for $^{32}$Mg and nearby nuclei \cite{Morten:r:motobayashi}.
\index{032Mg@$^{32}$Mg}
Inspired by the rich set of phenomena occurring near the $N = 20$
shell closure when $N \gg Z$, attention has been directed to nuclei
near the $N = 28$ (sub)shell closure for a number of S and Ar isotopes
\index{subshell closure!$N=28$}
\cite{Morten:r:brown1,Morten:r:brown2} where similar, but less dramatic, 
effects have been seen as well.

In parallel with the experimental efforts, there have been several
theoretical studies seeking to understand and, in some cases, predict
properties of these unstable nuclei.  Both mean-field
\cite{Morten:r:werner,Morten:r:campi} and shell-model calculations
\cite{Morten:r:brown1,Morten:r:brown2,Morten:r:wbmb,Morten:r:poves1,%
Morten:r:fukunishi,Morten:r:retamosa,Morten:r:caurier}
have been proposed. The latter require a severe truncation to
achieve tractable model spaces, since the successful description of these
nuclei involves active nucleons in both the $1s0d$- and the $1p0f$-shells.
The natural basis for the problem is therefore the full $1s0d$-$1p0f$
space, which puts it out of reach of exact diagonalisation on current
hardware\footnote{For a treatment of the CM problem, see 
Ref.~\citelow{Morten:drhklz99}.}.

\index{shell model!Monte Carlo}
Shell-model Monte Carlo (SMMC) methods \cite{Morten:david97,Morten:r:smmc_ar,Morten:r:lang} 
offer an alternative to direct
diagonalisation when the bases become very large. Though SMMC provides
limited detailed spectroscopic information, it can predict, with good
accuracy, overall nuclear properties such as masses, total strengths,
strength distributions, and deformation, precisely those quantities
probed by the recent experiments. 


There is limited experimental information about the highly unstable,
neutron-rich nuclei under consideration.  In many cases only the mass,
excitation energy of the first excited state, the $B(E2)$ to that state,
and the $\beta$-decay rate is known, and not even all of this
information is available in some cases.  From the
measured $B(E2)$, an estimate of the nuclear deformation parameter,
$\beta_2$, has been obtained via the usual relation
\begin{equation}
\beta_2 = 4 \pi \sqrt{B(E2; 0^+_{gs} \rightarrow 2^+_1)}/3 Z R_0^2 e
\end{equation}
with $R_0 = 1.2 A^{1/3}$ fm and $B(E2)$ given in $e^2$fm$^4$.

Much of the interest in the region stems from the unexpectedly large
values of the deduced $\beta_2$,  which suggest the onset of
deformation and have led to speculations about the vanishing of the $N
= 20$ and $N = 28$ shell gaps.  The lowering in energy of the 2$^+_1$
state supports this interpretation.  The most thoroughly studied case,
and the one which most convincingly demonstrates these phenomena, is
$^{32}$Mg with its extremely large $B(E2) = 454 \pm 78 \, e^2$fm$^4$ and
corresponding $\beta_2 = 0.513$ \cite{Morten:r:motobayashi}; however, a word of
caution is necessary when deciding on the basis of this
limited information that we are in the presence of well-deformed
rotors: for $^{22}$Mg, we would obtain $\beta_2 = 0.67$, even more
spectacular, and for $^{12}$C, $\beta_2 = 0.8$, well above the
superdeformed bands.

Most of the measured observables can be calculated within the SMMC
framework.  It is well known that in {\it deformed} nuclei the total
$B(E2)$ strength is almost saturated by the $0^+_{gs} \rightarrow
2_1^+$ transition (typically 80\% to 90\% of the strength lies in this
transition).  Thus the total strength calculated by SMMC should only
slightly overestimate the strength of the measured transition.  In
Table \ref{Morten:t:tab1} the SMMC computed values of $B(E2,
\mathrm{total})$ are compared both to the experimental $B(E2;
0^+_{\mathrm{gs}} \rightarrow 2^+_1)$ values and to the values found
in various truncated shell-model calculations.  Reasonable agreement
with experimental data across the space is obtained when one chooses
effective charges of $e_p=1.5$ and $e_n=0.5$.  All of the theoretical
calculations require excitations to the $1p0f$-shell before reasonable
values can be obtained.  We note a general agreement among all
calculations of the $B(E2)$ for $^{46}$Ar, although they are typically
larger than experimental data would suggest. We also note a somewhat
lower value of the $B(E2)$ in this calculation as compared to
experiment and other theoretical calculations in the case of $^{42}$S.
Table \ref{morten:t:tab3} gives selected occupation numbers for the
nuclei considered.  We first note a difficulty in extrapolating some
of the occupations where the number of particles is nearly zero.  This
leads to a systematic error bar that we estimate at $\pm 0.2$ for all
occupations shown, while the statistical error bar is quoted in the
Table. The extrapolations for occupation numbers were principally
linear. Table \ref{morten:t:tab3} 
shows that $^{22}$Mg remains as an almost pure
$sd$-shell nucleus, as expected.  We also see that the protons in
$^{30}$Ne, $^{32}$Mg, and $^{42}$Si are almost entirely confined to
the $sd$ shell.  This latter is a pleasing result in at least two
regards.  First, it shows that the interaction does not mix the two
shells to an unrealistically large extent.  Second, if spurious CM
contamination were a severe problem, we would expect to see a larger
proton $0f_{7/2}$ population for these nuclei due to the
$0d_{5/2}$-$0f_{7/2}$ ``transition'' mediated by the centre-of-mass
creation operator.  The fact that there is little proton $f_{7/2}$
occupation for these nuclei confirms that the CM contamination is
under reasonable control.  See Ref.~\citelow{Morten:drhklz99} for
further details.

An interesting feature of Table \ref{morten:t:tab3} lies in the neutron
occupations of the $N = 20$ nuclei ($^{30}$Ne and $^{32}$Mg) and the $N =
28$ nuclei ($^{42}$Si, $^{44}$S, and $^{46}$Ar).  The neutron
occupations of the two $N = 20$ nuclei are quite similar, confirming
the finding of Fukunishi {\it et al.} \cite{Morten:r:fukunishi} and Poves and
Retamosa \cite{Morten:r:poves1} that the $N= 20$ shell gap is modified.  In
fact, the neutron $0f_{7/2}$ orbital contains approximately two
particles before the $N=20$ closure, thus behaving like an intruder
single-particle state.  Furthermore, we see that 2p-2h excitations
dominate although higher excitations also play some role.  We also see
that the neutrons occupying the $1p0f$-shell in $N=20$ systems are
principally confined to the $0f_{7/2}$ sub-shell.
The conclusions that follow from looking at nuclei with $N > 20$,
particularly those with $N = 28$, are that the $N = 20$ shell is nearly
completely closed at this point, and that the $N=28$ shell closure is
reasonably robust, although approximately one neutron occupies the upper
part of the $1p0f$ shell. Coupling of the protons with the low-lying
neutron excitations probably accounts for the relatively large
$B(E2)$, without the need of invoking rotational behaviour.

\subsubsection{Heavy Sn isotopes}

Effective two-hole matrix elements are calculated based on 
a $Z = 50, \quad N = 82$ asymmetric core and 
with the active $P$-space for holes
based on the $2s_{1/2}$, $1d_{5/2}$, $1d_{3/2}$, $0g_{7/2}$ and $0h_{11/2}$
hole orbits. The CD-Bonn model for the NN interaction was employed
\cite{Morten:cdbonn} and all diagrams through third-order in the $G$ matrix
were included in the evaluation of the $\hat{Q}$ box. Folded diagrams
were again included through the method discussed above, see
Refs.~\citelow{Morten:hko95,Morten:ehho98} for further details.
The corresponding single-hole energies
$\varepsilon(d_{3/2}^{+}) = 0.00$~MeV, 
 $\varepsilon(h_{11/2}^{-}) = 0.242$~MeV, 
$\varepsilon(s_{1/2}^{+}) = 0.332$~MeV,
$\varepsilon(d_{5/2}^{+}) = 1.655$~MeV and  
$\varepsilon(g_{7/2}^{+}) = 2.434$~MeV
are taken from \mbox{Ref. \cite{Morten:jan}}
and the shell model calculation amounts to studying
valence neutron holes outside this core.
The shell model problem requires the solution of a real symmetric
$n \times n$ matrix eigenvalue equation
\begin{equation}
       \widetilde{H}\left | \Psi_k\right\rangle  = 
       E_k \left | \Psi_k\right\rangle .
       \label{Morten:eq:shell_model}
\end{equation}
where for the present cases the dimension of 
the $P$-space reaches $n \approx 2 \times 10^{7}$.
At present our basic approach in finding 
solutions to Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:shell_model})
is the Lanczos algorithm; an iterative method\index{Lanczos algorithm}
which gives the solution of the lowest eigenstates. This method was 
already applied to nuclear physics problems by Whitehead \emph{et al.}
in 1977. The technique is described in detail in Ref.~\citelow{Morten:whit77},
see also Ref.~\citelow{Morten:ehho95}.
The results of the shell model calculations are presented in Table 4.
All experimental information in the present analysis is taken 
from the database of the 
National Nuclear Data Center at \mbox{Brookhaven \cite{Morten:brook}}.

The isotopes above $^{116}$Sn (heavy Sn) are treated based 
on the asymmetric $Z = 50, N = 82$ core. 
This simplifies the shell model calculation, but it is of interest
to study the quality of a calculation based on
a hole-hole effective 
interaction calculated with respect to $^{132}$Sn.

Only some selected states are displayed. First of all, the 
near constant $0^{+} - 2^{+}$ spacing is well reproduced,
all the way down to the middle of the shell, for 
$^{116}$Sn.
The other states are also in very good agreement
with experiment. However more detailed analysis of 
the results close to $^{116}$Sn
indicates that our effective two-particle interaction 
has difficulties in reproducing
the shell closure which is believed to occur in this region. 
The increase of the 
the $0^{+} - 2^{+}$ splitting is not as sharp as found 
experimentally, even if the 
phenomenon is rather weak in the case of Sn.
We have observed a similar feature around $^{48}$Ca \cite{Morten:hko95}
\index{048Ca@$^{48}$Ca}
which is generally agreed
to be a good closed shell nucleus. There the deviation 
between theory and experiment 
is severe. Preliminary analysis indicates that our effective interaction
may be slightly too attractive when the two particles 
occupy different single-particle orbits.
This may be related to the radial wave functions which in our calculation are 
chosen to be harmonic oscillator functions.

\subsection{Inclusion of hole-hole contributions and 
single-particle propagators}

With the $G$ matrix defined according 
to the double-partitioned scheme we can easily solve Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12})
through matrix inversion. The number of hole-hole and particle-particle
configurations is then rather small, typically smaller than about
$100$, and a matrix inversion
is then rather trivial. 
Before we discuss the solution of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}), it is always
instructive to consider the contributions to second order in 
perturbation theory, i.e., diagrams (a) and (b) of Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:gamma12}. The external legs can be 
particle states or hole states. Diagram (a) reads
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(a)}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{pq}V^{[12]}_{12pq J}
      \frac{1}{s-\varepsilon_p-
                \varepsilon_q} V^{[12]}_{pq34 J},
      \label{Morten:eq:secondg}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(b)}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\alpha\beta}V^{[12]}_{12\alpha\beta J}
      \frac{1}{-s+\varepsilon_{\alpha}+
                \varepsilon_{\beta}} V^{[12]}_{\alpha\beta 34 J}.
\label{Morten:eq:diagramb}
\end{equation}
We note here the minus sign in the energy denominator,
since in the latter expression we are using
the hole-hole term of the propagator of
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator12}).
If we use a double-partitioned $G$ matrix for say $^{16}$O and
are interested in an effective valence space interaction
for the $1s0d$-shell\footnote{This means that the labels $1234$ will
refer to particle states in the $1s0d$-shell.}, then typically
the single-particle orbits of the intermediate states will be represented
by states in the $1p0f$ major shell. Hole states are then defined
by single-particle states in the $0s$ and $0p$ shells.
Clearly, the number of two-body intermediate states is rather limited. 
To third order we have diagrams like (c) and (d) of Fig.~
\ref{Morten:fig:gamma12}. Diagram (c) is just the third-order equivalent of
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:secondg}) and reads
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(c)}=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{pqrw}V^{[12]}_{12pq J}
      \frac{1}{s-\varepsilon_p-
                \varepsilon_q} 
      V^{[12]}_{pqrw J}
      \frac{1}{s-\varepsilon_r-
                \varepsilon_w} 
       V^{[12]}_{rw34 J},
      \label{Morten:eq:thirdg}
\end{equation}
while diagram (d) contains both a two-particle and a two-hole 
intermediate state and reads
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(d)}=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{\alpha\beta pq}V^{[12]}_{12pq J}
      \frac{1}{s-\varepsilon_p-
                \varepsilon_q+\varepsilon_{\alpha}+
                \varepsilon_{\beta}} 
      V^{[12]}_{pq\alpha\beta J}
      \frac{1}{s-\varepsilon_p-
                \varepsilon_q} 
       V^{[12]}_{\alpha\beta 34 J}.
      \label{Morten:eq:thirdg2h}
\end{equation}
Thus, solving Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}) will then
yield contributions to the effective interaction
such as the above expressions. 
 
Here we have also tacitly assumed that the energy denominators do not
diverge, i.e., we have chosen an energy $s$ so that we avoid the
poles. This has always been the standard approach in calculations of
shell-model effective interactions. To give an example, consider now
diagram (b) and suppose that we are using harmonic oscillator wave
functions. Let us also assume that the two hole states are from the
$0p$-shell and that the valence particles are in the $1s0d$-shell. If
we rescale the energies of the valence space to zero, then the energy of the
two-hole state would become $\varepsilon_\alpha+\varepsilon_\beta=-28$ MeV with
an oscillator parameter $b=1.72$ fm. If $s=-28$, the denominator in 
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:diagramb}) 
diverges.  In this case it is rather easy to obtain the imaginary
part, and even if we were to chose $s$ different from $-28$ MeV, the
imaginary part will influence the real part of the effective
interaction through dispersion relations, see, e.g.,
Refs.~\citelow{Morten:angels88,Morten:rpd89,Morten:ms92}.  It is
therefore at best just a first approximation to neglect the imaginary
term.  Moreover, if we solve Dyson's equation for the self-energy, the
single-particle energies may contain an imaginary part.  Technically
it is  not difficult to deal with imaginary contributions, one
needs to invert a complex matrix rather than a real one.  However,
poles need to be located carefully,
see
Ref.~\citelow{Morten:landau97} for a computational approach to this
problem. In our actual calculations we will also follow
Ref.~\citelow{Morten:landau97}. These technicalities will however be
described elsewhere \cite{Morten:mhj99}.

Using the double-partitioned $G$ matrix, we can then rewrite
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}) as
\begin{equation}
      \Gamma^{[12]}_{1234J}(s) = 
      G^{[12]}_{1234J}+\frac{1}{2}
      \sum_{56}
      G^{[12]}_{1256J}\hat{{\cal G}}^{[12]}
      \Gamma^{[12]}_{5634J}(s),
      \label{Morten:eq:newfirst12}
\end{equation}
where $G^{[12]}$ is just the double-partitioned $G$ matrix
discussed above. It is also energy dependent,
in contrast to $V$.
In case we were to employ this equation for effective
interactions in the $1s0d$-shell, the intermediate two-particle
states would then come from just e.g., the $1p0f$-shell.
This equation, which now is solved within a much smaller space
than the original one spanned by the total $Q_{pp}$, allows
clearly for computationally amenable solutions. It corresponds
to the so-called {\em model-space approach} to the solution
of the Feynman-Galitskii equations 
\index{Feynman-Galitskii equations!model space approach to} 
as advocated by
Kuo and co-workers, see e.g., Ref.~\citelow{Morten:kt94}
for more details. Thus, a possible approach would consist
of the following steps 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Solve the $G$ matrix equation from Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:gmod})
      using the double-partitioning scheme.
\item The next step is then to solve Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12})
      and Dyson's equation for the self-energy.
\item This scheme is iterated till self-consistency is achieved,
      see the discussion below. 
\end{enumerate}
We will however not employ this {\em model-space} scheme in our
actual calculations. There are several reasons for not doing so.

Let us first assume that we omit the $[13]$ and $[14]$ channels in our
iterative scheme for Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:newfirst12}). 
The next iteration of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:newfirst12}) 
would then look like 
\begin{equation}
      \Gamma^{[12]}_{(1)} = 
      \Gamma_{(0)}^{[12]}+
      \Gamma_{(0)}^{[12]}
       \hat{{\cal G}}^{[12]}\Gamma^{[12]}_{(1)},
      \label{Morten:eq:second12}
\end{equation}
where the vertex function $\Gamma_{(0)}^{[12]}$ is the solution
of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:newfirst12}). However, we cannot define
the ``bare'' vertex $\Gamma_{(0)}^{[12]}$ to be the 
solution  of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:newfirst12}) simply because then we 
would be double-counting contributions.
Thus, $\Gamma_{(0)}^{[12]}$ has to equal the $G$ matrix.
The only change in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:second12}) 
arises from the solution of Dyson's equation
and thereby new single-particle energies. 

Let us then for the sake of simplicity assume that the single-particle
energies are just the Hartree-Fock solutions. The problem we are
aiming at arises at the Hartree-Fock level.  In order to obtain
Hartree-Fock solutions which are independent of the chosen harmonic
oscillator parameter $b$, we typically need to include single-particle
orbits from many major shells.  For \index{Brueckner-Hartree-Fock}
Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) calculations for finite nuclei we have
found that we need at least $2n+l \leq 20$ in order to obtain a result
which is independent of the chosen HO length $b$.\footnote{Throughout this work
our unperturbed single-particle basis will always be
that of the harmonic oscillator.} 
The way we solve the BHF
equations is to expand the new single-particle wave functions
$\psi_{\lambda}$, with $\lambda$ representing the quantum numbers
$nlj$, in terms of harmonic oscillator wave functions, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
     \left | \psi_{\lambda}\right\rangle=
     \sum_{\alpha =1}^{2n+l\leq 20} 
     C_{\alpha}^{(\lambda )}\left | \phi_{\alpha}\right\rangle
     \label{Morten:eq:selfconstbasis}
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{\alpha}$ are the harmonic oscillator wave functions
with quantum numbers $\alpha=nlj$ and $C$ are the coefficients
to be varied in the Hartree-Fock calculations.
The single-particle energies at the 
Hartree-Fock level are just
\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon_{\alpha}=t_{\alpha}+
   \sum_h \bra{\alpha h} G(\varepsilon_{\alpha}+
                           \varepsilon_h)
          \ket{\alpha h},
\end{equation}
where the single-particle states are just those
of the harmonic oscillator. The $G$ matrix used in the 
first iteration in the BHF calculation is the one given
by the solution of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:gmod}).
The coefficients 
$C_{\alpha}$ can then be obtained by diagonalising
a matrix of dimension $N\times N$, where $N$ is the number
of single-particle orbits with the same $lj$ values.
As an example, suppose that we are considering the 
$s_{1/2}$ state with $l=0$ and $j=1/2$. With the above
requirement $2n+l\leq 20$, we may have
that $N_{\mathrm{max}}=10$, the dimensionality being equal to 
the quantum number $n$. 
The way to proceed in a BHF calculation is to calculate
the reference $G$ matrix $G_F$ in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:freeg})
once and for all\footnote{This matrix is typically
set up in the relative and CM system and calculated
only once 
for $b=1$ fm. Other $b$-values involve simply
a multiplication with a constant. The matrix $G_F$ can therefore
be used for other mass areas as well.} .
Thereafter, the change in single-particle wave functions
is introduced in the calculations of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:gmod}).

We see then that if we choose to do 
the Hartree-Fock self-consistency
employing the double-partitioned $G$ matrix and summing
the pphh diagrams as in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:second12}), 
our single-particle basis will just be
defined by the $0s$, $0p$, $1s0d$ and $1p0f$ shells in the case
of an effective interaction in the $1s0d$-shell. 
{\em This is simply
not enough in order to obtain a stable Brueckner-Hartree-Fock
result.}  

The reader could infer that why do we not perform first a BHF
calculation for the $G$ matrix in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:gmod}), and then
solve Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}) and stop there.  This would be in
line with the abovementioned {\em model-space approach} of Kuo and
co-workers \cite{Morten:kt94}.  However, if one calculates the
self-energy by only including particle-particle intermediate states in
the vertex function $\Gamma$, which is the case if we do a standard
BHF calculation, one may seriously violate various sum rules,
such as the conservation of number of particles, as
demonstrated in Refs.~\cite{Morten:ms92,Morten:mahaux85}.  Thus, these
sum rules 
constrain severely the way we solve Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12})
and (\ref{Morten:eq:dyson12}).  The vertex function needs both
particle-particle and hole-hole intermediate states in order to
eventually satisfy  the conservation of the number of particles.
In section \ref{Morten:sec:sec5} we will come back to the
technical solution of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}) and its
iterations. 


Moreover, our interest lies in solving
the Parquet equations. This
entails simply that we perform the above
self-consistency. 
It is therefore not only a matter of many-body aestethics for
embarking on the solution of the Parquet equations.
We are also able to satisfy various sum rules.

\index{Parquet equations|(}
\section[Screening corrections and vertex renormalisation]{Screening corrections and vertex renormalisation, the equations
for the $[13]$ and $[14]$ channels}
\label{Morten:sec:sec4}

We start as in the previous section with the definition of the interaction
vertices in the $[13]$ and $[14]$ channels and the corresponding
integral equations. Thereafter, we discuss various approximations
to these equations such as the summation of TDA and RPA diagrams.
\index{TDA} \index{RPA}
Eventually, the aim is to merge the discussion in this section and 
the preceeding one into equations for a self-consistent scheme which combines 
all three channels, namely the so-called set of Parquet equations to
be discussed in section \ref{Morten:sec:sec5}. 

The equations for the renormalised vertex in the $[13]$ and $[14]$
channels have the same form as Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:schematic12}), namely
\begin{equation}
     \Gamma^{[13]}=V^{[13]}+V^{[13]}(gg)\Gamma^{[13]},
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
     \Gamma^{[14]}=V^{[14]}+V^{[14]}(gg)\Gamma^{[14]}.
\end{equation}
The matrix elements which enter are however defined differently and
the irreducible diagrams of $V^{[13]}$ and $V^{[14]}$ can obviously
not be the same.  With irreducible in the $[13]$ channel we will mean
a diagram, which by cutting an internal particle-hole pair, cannot be
separated into a piece containing the external legs $1,3$ and another
piece containing $2,4$ as external legs. The definition for the
irreducible vertex in the $[14]$ channel is similar and we illustrate
these differences in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:1314channel}.
\begin{figure}%[tbh]
%      \setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}

	\end{center}
      \caption{Examples of irreducible and reducible diagrams in the 
               $[13]$ and $[14]$ channels. See text for further details.}
      \label{Morten:fig:1314channel}
\end{figure}
Diagram (a) is just the lowest-order
interaction in the $[13]$ channel and is therefore irreducible.
Diagram (b) is an irreducible diagram in the $[13]$ channel,
whereas it is reducible in the $[14]$ channel. Diagram (c) is in turn
irreducible in the $[14]$ channel and reducible in the $[13]$ channel. 
Diagram (d) is an example of a diagram which is irreducible in both
channels. This diagram stems from the $[12]$ channel.

The energy variables in these channels are, following
Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:channelsdef} and Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:13channel}) and
(\ref{Morten:eq:14channel}),
\begin{equation} 
     t=\varepsilon_3-\varepsilon_1=\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_4,
\end{equation}    
for the $[13]$ channel and
\begin{equation}
     u=\varepsilon_1-\varepsilon_4=\varepsilon_3-\varepsilon_2,
\end{equation}
for the $[14]$ channel.
Defining the unperturbed particle-hole propagators 
in the energy representation as \cite{Morten:kt94}
\begin{equation}
    \hat{{\cal G}}^{[13]}=
    \frac{Q^{[13]}_{\mathrm{ph}}}{t-\varepsilon_p+\varepsilon_h+\imath \eta}
    -\frac{Q^{[13]}_{\mathrm{hp}}}{t+\varepsilon_p-\varepsilon_h-\imath \eta},
    \label{Morten:eq:paulioperator13}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
    \hat{{\cal G}}^{[14]}=
    \frac{Q^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}}{u-\varepsilon_p+\varepsilon_h+\imath \eta}
    -\frac{Q^{[14]}_{\mathrm{hp}}}{u+\varepsilon_p-\varepsilon_h-\imath \eta}
    \label{Morten:eq:paulioperator14}
\end{equation}
we arrive at the following equations 
for the interaction vertex in these two channels
\begin{equation}
      \Gamma^{[13]}_{1234J}(t) = 
      V^{[13]}_{1234J}+
      \sum_{ph}
      V^{[13]}_{12phJ}\hat{{\cal G}}^{[13]}
      \Gamma^{[13]}_{ph34J}(t),
      \label{Morten:eq:first13}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
      \Gamma^{[14]}_{1234J}(u) = 
      V^{[14]}_{1234J}-
      \sum_{ph}
      V^{[14]}_{12phJ}\hat{{\cal G}}^{[14]}
      \Gamma^{[14]}_{ph34J}(u).
      \label{Morten:eq:first14}
\end{equation}
These equations, together with Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}),
can then form the basis for the first iteration in a self-consistent 
scheme for renormalisation corrections of the Parquet type.
The origin of the minus sign in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first14}) follows from 
the diagram rules \cite{Morten:kstop81} and will be exemplified below.
A graphical view of these equations is given in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:figs1314}.
\begin{figure}%[tbh]

\caption{The upper half (a) shows the structure of
the integral equation for the interaction vertex in the $[13]$
channel. (b) represents the integral channel for the $[14]$
channel.  The coupling order is displayed as well.}
\label{Morten:fig:figs1314}
\end{figure}
The reader should also keep in mind the two contributions to the
particle propagators of Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator13}) and
(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator14}).  See Ref.~\citelow{Morten:kt94} for
a physical interpretation.

In this section we will omit a discussion of the self-energy corrections
which arise from these channels. This
will be relegated to the next section. In the nuclear
case, due to the strongly repulsive short-range character 
of the interaction, we will have 
to replace in actual calculations 
the bare interaction in the irreducible vertices $[13]$ and $[14]$
with the $G$ matrix discussed in the previous section. 
Doing this entails already a first step towards the Parquet set of equations,
in the sense that we are including short-range correlations from the 
$[12]$ channel. 
Here we will however limit the discussion to expressions 
in terms of the interaction $V$.
The aim is to try 
to recover from Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first13}) 
and (\ref{Morten:eq:first14}) the familiar TDA and RPA equations and the 
so-called self-consistent coupled equations of Kirson \cite{Morten:kirson74}.
The hope is that these intermediate steps can bridge the 
gap between the familiar
TDA, RPA and $G$ matrix equations and the Parquet set of equations
in section \ref{Morten:sec:sec5}. 



\subsection{Screened ph  and 2p2h interactions}


Here we study the screening of the particle-hole
and the 2p2h interactions given in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:wavef1},
indicated by $V_{ph}$ and $V_{2p2h}$, respectively.
Before we list the final expression, it is however instructive
to consider the corrections to second order in the interaction $V$ to the ph
and 2p2h vertices. 
In Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:phvertex} we display the second-order
corrections to the ph diagrams of Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:wavef1}.
Diagram (a) is the core-polarisation correction term to the
particle-hole interaction, and corresponds to a contribution from the
$[14]$ channel, as indicated by the coupling order.  The term labelled
(b) corresponds to the exchange term of (a) and is coupled in the
$[13]$-order, see also the discussion in connection with
Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:ph13}) and (\ref{Morten:eq:ph14}).  The other
corrections, like (c) and (d) include particle-particle and hole-hole
intermediate states, respectively.  They are irreducible in both the
$[13]$ channel and the $[14]$ channel, and can therefore enter the
irreducible vertices of these two channels in later iterations.  They
are however not generated by various iterations of
Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first13}) and (\ref{Morten:eq:first14}). In fact,
if we replace $V$ by $G$ in Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first13}) and
(\ref{Morten:eq:first14}), diagram (c) is already accounted for by the
$G$ matrix. It may however be included if the double-partitioned $G$
matrix of the previous section is used.  Let us now look at the
analytical expressions in an angular momentum coupled basis for
diagrams (a) and (b) of Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:phvertex}. Here we just
include the first term in the propagators of
Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator13}) and
(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator14}). The second terms will give rise to
the 2p2h contributions discussed below. In the following discussion we
will also assume that the interaction $V$ does not depend on the
energy, although it is rather easy to generalise to an energy
dependent interaction.  Diagram (a) reads
\begin{figure}%[tbh]
%      \setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}
%      \begin{picture}(100,40)
%      \put(25,0){\epsfxsize=7cm \epsfbox{secph.eps}}
%      \end{picture}
	\begin{center}
      	\includegraphics[width=11cm]{secph.eps}
	\end{center}
      \caption{Second-order perturbative corrections to the ph
               interaction vertex.}
      \label{Morten:fig:phvertex}
\end{figure}
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(a)}=-\sum_{r\gamma}(-)^{j_r+j_{\gamma}-J}(-)^{2j_{\gamma}}
      V^{[14]}_{p\gamma r\alpha J}
      \frac{1}{u+\varepsilon_{\gamma}-
                \varepsilon_{r}} V^{[14]}_{r\beta q\gamma J},
       \label{Morten:eq:secordph}
\end{equation}
The factor $(-)^{2j_{\gamma}}$ stems from the opening up
and recoupling of an internal particle-hole pair \cite{Morten:kstop81}
and the phase $(-)^{j_r+j_{\gamma}-J}$ is needed in order
to rewrite the matrix elements in the coupling order of
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:13channel}).
The general structure of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:secordph}) is
just of the form $-V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}Q^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}/\epsilon^{[14]}V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}$, with
$ \epsilon^{[14]}=\varepsilon_{q}+\varepsilon_{\gamma}-\varepsilon_{\beta}-
                \varepsilon_{r}=u+\varepsilon_{\gamma}-\varepsilon_{r}$
and we have defined
\begin{equation}
  u=\varepsilon_{q}-\varepsilon_{\beta}=\varepsilon_{p}-\varepsilon_{\alpha},
\end{equation}
for the on-shell energy case.
This is the equivalent of the energy variable of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:energy12}) in
the $[12]$ channel.
Diagram (b) is in turn given by
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(b)}=\sum_{r\gamma}(-)^{j_r+j_{\gamma}-J}(-)^{2j_{\gamma}}
      V^{[13]}_{\gamma pr\alpha J}
      \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[13]}}V^{[13]}_{\beta rq\gamma J} ,
       \label{Morten:eq:secordphdirect}
\end{equation}
and we note that the contributions are clearly different.
The minus sign in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:secordph}) stems from the standard
diagram rules \cite{Morten:kstop81}. 
In our use of the diagram rules below, we will omit the use
of the rule for the number of external valence hole lines.
In our case then, as can also be deduced from inspection of
Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:phvertex}, diagram (a) has  zero closed loops and
three hole lines,
giving thereby rise to a minus sign. 
Diagram (b) has an additional closed
loop and thereby yielding the plus sign.
The energy denominator is in this case
\begin{equation} 
      \epsilon^{[13]}=t+\varepsilon_{\gamma}-\varepsilon_{r},
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
  t=\varepsilon_{q}-\varepsilon_{\beta}=\varepsilon_{p}-\varepsilon_{\alpha}.
\end{equation}
We notice, using the relations discussed
in Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:ph13})
and (\ref{Morten:eq:ph14}), that diagram (a) is simply the 
exchange diagram of (b). We need however to include
both diagrams in order to obtain an
antisymmetric equation for the particle-hole channels
which exhibits the same properties as the $[12]$ channel
shown in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:symproperties}). {\em This is actually crucial
in solving the Parquet equations. We wish that 
every iteration, with a given approximation to the 
vertex function $V$, preserves the antisymmetry property.}
This point cannot be emphasised enough. Let us now see what 
happens to third order in the interaction.

\end{figure}
Third order corrections to the ph vertices (a) and (b)   
 involving only ph intermediate states are
shown in (a) and (b) of Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:phhigher}, respectively.
The analytical expression for the third-order contribution (a) is given by
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(a)}=\sum_{rs\gamma\delta}f
      V^{[14]}_{p\gamma r\alpha J}
      \frac{1}{u+\varepsilon_{\gamma}
       -\varepsilon_{r} } V^{[14]}_{r\delta s\gamma J}
      \frac{1}{u+\varepsilon_{\delta}
       -\varepsilon_{s} } V^{[14]}_{s\beta q\delta J},
       \label{Morten:eq:thirdpha}
\end{equation}
with $f=(-)^{j_r+j_s+j_{\gamma}+j_{\delta}-2J}
      (-)^{2j_{\gamma}+2j_{\delta}}$. This
equation has the general structure
\[
            V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}
            \frac{Q_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
             V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}
            \frac{Q_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
            V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}.
\]
A similar expression applies to diagram (b), whose expression
is
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(b)}=\sum_{rs\gamma\delta}f
      V^{[13]}_{\gamma pr\alpha J}
      \frac{1}{t+\varepsilon_{\gamma}
        -\varepsilon_{r} } V^{[13]}_{\gamma rs\delta J}
      \frac{1}{t+\varepsilon_{\delta}
               -\varepsilon_{s} } V^{[13]}_{\beta s q\delta J}.
       \label{Morten:eq:thirdphb}
\end{equation}
It has the general structure
\[
            V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[13]}
            \frac{Q_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[13]}}{\epsilon^{[13]}}
             V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[13]}
            \frac{Q_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[13]}}{\epsilon^{[13]}}
            V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[13]}.
\]
But these expressions have the same sign! Diagram (a) counts
now 4 hole lines, and (b) counts also 4 hole lines and 2 closed
loops. However, {\em there are three interaction terms $V$}, 
and taking
the exchange term of each of these in diagram (a) leads to
the desired results, namely $\mathrm{(a)}=-\mathrm{(b)}$, as it should.
Thus, to third order we keep the antisymmetry property of 
$\Gamma$ in the $[13]$ and $[14]$ channels.
It is easy to see that in the $[14]$ channel we will always
have an alternating sign in front of each contribution, 
since every new order in perturbation theory brings a new hole
line and no closed loop, and thus a new minus sign.
In the $[13]$ channel we have always one new hole line and
one new closed loop for every new vertex. 
If we consider only the screening of the ph vertex, we can then set up
a perturbative expansion in terms of the ph vertex for the 
vertex functions $\Gamma^{[13]}$ and $\Gamma^{[14]}$. 
For notational economy we will skip the Pauli operators
$Q_{\mathrm{ph,hp}}^{[ij]}$ in the discussions below.
It will always be understood that the intermediate states
are two-body particle-hole states, $\left| \mathrm{ph}\right\rangle$ or
$\left| \mathrm{hp}\right\rangle$. 
Consider e.g.,
$\Gamma^{[14]}$ 
\begin{equation}
       \Gamma^{[14]}=V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}-
        V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}
        \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
        V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}+
        V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}
        \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
        V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}
        \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
        V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}-+\dots,
\end{equation}
which can be summed up to yield 
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma^{[14]}=V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}-
   V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}
   \frac{1}
   {\epsilon^{[14]}-V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}}
   V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}=
   V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}-
   V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}
   \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[14]}}\Gamma^{[14]},
   \label{Morten:eq:screening1}
\end{equation}
which is the standard TDA expression for the ph term.
\index{TDA!expression for ph term}
The corresponding expression in the $[13]$ channel 
results in
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma^{[13]}=V^{[13]}_{\mathrm{ph}}+
   V^{[13]}_{\mathrm{ph}}
   \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[13]}}\Gamma^{[13]}.
\end{equation}
The signs agree with the 
expressions of Blaizot and Ripka \cite{Morten:br86}, see chapter 15 and
Eq.~(15.50).
The summations in both channels ensures that the final vertex
is antisymmetric and the combination of 
the latter two equations results in the familiar
\index{TDA equations}
TDA equations, see  Ref.~\citelow{Morten:kt94} for a matrix equation
version.

               vertex.}
       \label{Morten:fig:pphhvertex}
\end{figure}


We next look at the $2p2h$ matrix element and show the
corresponding corrections to second order in perturbation
theory in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:pphhvertex}.
If we omit diagrams (e) and (f) which contain 2p and 2h 
intermediate states generated by the solutions
in $[12]$ channel, we have 
for diagram (a)
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(a)}=-\sum_{r\gamma}(-)^{j_r+j_{\gamma}-J}
      (-)^{2j_{\gamma}}
      V^{[14]}_{\gamma\beta qr J}
      \frac{1}{-u+\varepsilon_{\gamma}-
                \varepsilon_{r}} V^{[14]}_{pr\gamma\alpha J},
       \label{Morten:eq:2p2ha}
\end{equation}
with the general structure
\begin{equation}
    -V_{\mathrm{2p2h}}^{[14]}
     \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
     V_{\mathrm{2p2h}}^{[14]}.
\end{equation}
Note  the minus sign in front of $u$. The contribution from the 
propagator can in this case be retraced to the second
term of the propagator of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator14}).
Diagram (a) follows the coupling order of the $[14]$ channel.
It is also easy to see that diagram (b) is given by
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(b)}=-\sum_{r\gamma}(-)^{j_r+j_{\gamma}-J}
      (-)^{2j_{\gamma}}
      V^{[14]}_{\gamma q \beta r J}
      \frac{1}{-u+\varepsilon_{\gamma}-
                \varepsilon_{r}} V^{[14]}_{pr\gamma\alpha J},
       \label{Morten:eq:2p2hb}
\end{equation}
and has the structure
\begin{equation}
    -V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}
     \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
     V_{\mathrm{2p2h}}^{[14]}.
\end{equation}
Similarly, if we now move to the $[13]$ channel we have 
the following expressions
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(c)}=\sum_{r\gamma}(-)^{j_r+j_{\gamma}-J}
      (-)^{2j_{\gamma}}
      V^{[13]}_{\beta\gamma qr J}
      \frac{1}{-t+\varepsilon_{\gamma}-
                \varepsilon_{r}} V^{[13]}_{qp\gamma\alpha J},
       \label{Morten:eq:2p2hc}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(d)}=\sum_{r\gamma}(-)^{j_r+j_{\gamma}-J}
      (-)^{2j_{\gamma}}
      V^{[13]}_{\gamma q r\alpha J}
      \frac{1}{-t+\varepsilon_{\gamma}-
                \varepsilon_{r}} V^{[13]}_{pr\beta\gamma J},
       \label{Morten:eq:2p2hd}
\end{equation}
with the general structure
\begin{equation}
    V_{\mathrm{2p2h}}^{[13]}
     \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[13]}}
     V_{\mathrm{2p2h}}^{[13]},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[13]}
     \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[13]}}
     V_{\mathrm{2p2h}}^{[13]},
\end{equation}
respectively. Diagram (c) is just the exchange of (a)
and includes two 2p2h vertices, while diagram (d) is the exchange
of diagram (b) and includes a ph vertex multiplied with
a 2p2h vertex. We note again that the antisymmetry is
ensured at a given order in the interaction only
if we include the corrections at the same level in both
channels.
One can then easily sum up higher-order corrections 
to the 2p2h diagrams in both channels  as well.
The inclusion of the backward going particle-hole
pair in  Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator13})
and (\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator14}) ensures that we will
also sum to infinite order 2p2h corrections.
This leads ultimately to the familiar RPA equations,
see, e.g., Refs.~\citelow{Morten:eo77,Morten:kt94}.  
\index{RPA}

A closer inspection of Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:2p2hb}) and
(\ref{Morten:eq:2p2hd}) shows that if we only include ph vertices,
we could resum these corrections to infinite
order for the 2p2h vertex by observing that the 
structure of such diagrams would be of the form
(e.g., in the $[14]$ channel )
\begin{equation}
       \Gamma_{\mathrm{2p2h}}^{[14]}=V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{2p2h}}-
        V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}
        \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
        V_{\mathrm{2p2h}}^{[14]}+
        V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}
        \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
        V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}
        \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
        V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{2p2h}}.
             +\dots,
\end{equation}
which can be summed up to yield 
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma^{[14]}_{\mathrm{2p2h}}=V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{2p2h}}-
   V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}
   \frac{1}
   {\epsilon^{[14]}-V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{ph}}}
   V^{[14]}_{\mathrm{2p2h}},
   \label{Morten:eq:screening2}
\end{equation}
and similarly for the $[13]$ channel, but with a plus sign.
The modifications discussed in Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:screening1})
and (\ref{Morten:eq:screening2})
serve to modify the propagation of a particle-hole pair
and are usually called propagator
renormalisations, as can easily be understood from 
\index{renormalisation!propagator}
Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:screening1})
and (\ref{Morten:eq:screening2}) where the propagation of 
a free particle-hole pair is modified by the presence 
of the interaction $V$ in the energy denominator.
Other important processes which can affect 
various polarisation terms are those 
represented by so-called vertex renormalisations,
a term originally introduced by Kirson and Zamick \cite{Morten:kz70}.
These authors studied the renormalisations of the 
2p1h and 2h1p vertices as well, see also Kirson \cite{Morten:kirson74}
and Ellis and Osnes \cite{Morten:eo77} for further discussions.
We will therefore end the discussion in this section
by looking at such renormalisations.

\subsection{Further renormalisations}

               vertex.}
       \label{Morten:fig:2p1hvertex}
\end{figure}


In the previous subsection we dealt mainly with what has 
conventionally been labelled for propagator
renormalisations. We will therefore extend the standard TDA and RPA 
schemes by looking at further ways of renormalising   
interaction vertices. 
The approach discussed here follows 
Kirson \cite{Morten:kirson74}. Extensions were made later 
by Ellis and Goodin \cite{Morten:eg80} and
Ellis, Mavromatis and M\"uther \cite{Morten:emm91}. 
We will limit the discussion here to the scheme of Kirson.
We start therefore with the contributions to second
order to the 2p1h vertex.\footnote{The discussion here applies as well to the 
other interaction vertices discussed in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:wavef1}.}\ 
These contributions are shown in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:2p1hvertex}. 
Diagram (a) consists of a 2p1h vertex multiplied with a 
ph vertex whereas (b) stems from the multiplication
of a 2p2h vertex with a 2p1h vertex. They both contain
a particle-hole pair as an intermediate state and
follow the  coupling order of the $[14]$ channel.
The exchange diagram of (b)  is given by 
(c), while that of (a) is diagram (d). Diagrams (e) and (f)
represent contributions from the $[12]$ channel
and are irreducible in both particle-hole channels. 
Before we sketch the 
general structure of the renormalisation 
procedure of Kirson, it is instructive to consider
again the equations to second order in perturbation theory,
as the general expressions can be deduced from inspection
of these diagrams. \index{Kirson's renormalisation procedure}
Diagram (a) is
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(a)}=\sum_{r\gamma}(-)^{j_r+j_{\gamma}-J}
      (-)^{2j_{\gamma}}
      V^{[14]}_{p\gamma r\alpha J}
      \frac{1}{u+\varepsilon_{\gamma}-
                \varepsilon_{r}} V^{[14]}_{rsq\gamma J},
       \label{Morten:eq:2p1ha}
\end{equation}
and the plus sign stems 
from the diagram rules \cite{Morten:kstop81}, 
i.e., we
have two hole lines and no closed loop.
The propagator is that arising
from the first term in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator14}).
The  general structure is
\begin{equation}
     V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}
     \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
     V_{\mathrm{2p1h}}^{[14]}.
     \label{Morten:eq:2p1hseca}
\end{equation}
Diagram (b) reads
\begin{equation}
      \mathrm{(b)}=\sum_{r\gamma}(-)^{j_r+j_{\gamma}-J}
      (-)^{2j_{\gamma}}
      V^{[14]}_{pr\gamma\alpha J}
      \frac{1}{-u+\varepsilon_{\gamma}-
                \varepsilon_r} V^{[14]}_{\gamma sqr J},
       \label{Morten:eq:2p1hb}
\end{equation}
with the following structure
\begin{equation}
     V_{\mathrm{2p1h}}^{[14]}
     \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
     V_{\mathrm{2p2h}}^{[14]}.
     \label{Morten:eq:2p1hsecb}
\end{equation}
In this case the propagator stems from the second term
in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator14}).
Similar equations arise for  the 2h1p
vertices of Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:wavef1}. 

\index{Kirson's self-consistent equations}
Before we write down the self-consistent equations
of Kirson \cite{Morten:kirson74}, let us assume that we
can approximate the 2p1h vertex in the $[14]$ channel 
by the first order term and diagrams (a) and (b).
This renormalised vertex, which we here label
$\tilde{V}_{2p1h}$, is then given by
\begin{equation}
     \tilde{V}_{2p1h}\approx {V}_{2p1h}^{[14]}
     +V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}
     \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
     V_{\mathrm{2p1h}}^{[14]}+
     V_{\mathrm{2p1h}}^{[14]}
     \frac{1}{\epsilon^{[14]}}
     V_{\mathrm{2p2h}}^{[14]}.
     \label{Morten:eq:2p1hsecondorder}     
\end{equation} 
If we now allow for the screening to infinite order
of the ph vertex given by Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:screening1})
and replace the 2p2h vertex in the above equation
with Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:screening2}) we obtain the following
renormalisation of the 2p1h vertex
\begin{equation}
     \tilde{V}_{2p1h}= {V}_{2p1h}^{[14]}
     +V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}
     \frac{1}
     {\epsilon^{[14]}-V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}}
     V_{\mathrm{2p1h}}^{[14]}+
     V_{\mathrm{2p1h}}^{[14]}
     \frac{1}
     {\epsilon^{[14]}-V_{\mathrm{ph}}^{[14]}}
     V_{\mathrm{2p2h}}^{[14]}.
     \label{Morten:eq:screening3}
\end{equation} 
A similar equation applies to the 2h1p vertex of
Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:wavef1} and
for the $[13]$ channel. Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:screening1}),
(\ref{Morten:eq:screening2}) and (\ref{Morten:eq:screening3}) form then
the starting point for the approach of Kirson \cite{Morten:kirson74}.
Examples of diagrams which can be obtained through the 
iterative solution of Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:screening1}),
(\ref{Morten:eq:screening2}) and (\ref{Morten:eq:screening3})
are given in Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:kirsoniterate}.
\begin{figure}[tbh]
%      \setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}

       \caption{Examples of diagrams which can arise from Kirson's
                self-consistent equations.}
       \label{Morten:fig:kirsoniterate}
\end{figure}

The question is now  how 
Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:screening1}), (\ref{Morten:eq:screening2}) and
(\ref{Morten:eq:screening3}) are related to
Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first13}) and (\ref{Morten:eq:first14}).  This is
rather trivial if we recall that the labels $1234$ can, as was also
discussed in section \ref{Morten:sec:sec2}, represent either
single-particle or single-hole states. Thus, $V_{1234}$
can represent a 2p1h, 2h1p, 2p2h, 2p, 2h or a ph vertex.  This means
that, due to the choice of propagators in
Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator13}) and
(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator14}) equations like
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:screening3}) are already inherent in
Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first13}) and (\ref{Morten:eq:first14}). If we
truncate  Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first14}) to second order in the
interaction $V$ and let the single-particle labels $1234$ represent a
2p1h interaction vertex, we immediately obtain
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:2p1hsecondorder}). If we let $1234$ represent a
2p2h vertex, we find to second order diagrams (a)-(d) of Fig.\
\ref{Morten:fig:pphhvertex}.


Until now now we have refrained from discussing the contributions
from the $[12]$ channel, examples were only shown in (c) and (d) of
Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:phvertex}, (e) and (f) of
Figs.~\ref{Morten:fig:pphhvertex} and \ref{Morten:fig:2p1hvertex}.
These diagrams cannot be generated by simply iterating the equations
for the $[13]$ and $[14]$ channels, but they could enter as
contributions to the irreducible vertex in the $[13]$ and $[14]$
channels from the first iteration in the $[12]$-channel.  We see thus
the emerging contour of an iterative scheme.  The crucial point is
however how to perform the next iteration of say
Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:screening1}), (\ref{Morten:eq:screening2}) and
(\ref{Morten:eq:screening3}) or Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first13}),
(\ref{Morten:eq:first14}) and (\ref{Morten:eq:first12}) from the
$[12]$ channel. The question is how do we include the results from the
first iteration into the next one, i.e., how to modify the bare
vertices $V^{[13]}$ and $V^{[14]}$ in 
Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first13}) and (\ref{Morten:eq:first14}) in order
to obtain an effective interaction for the shell model.  We have also
not addressed how to deal with the solution of Dyson's equation for
the one-body Green's function.  
\index{Dyson's equation}
We mention also that Ellis and Goodin
\cite{Morten:eg80} included pp correlations, i.e., terms from the
$[12]$ channel such as diagram (e) of
Fig.~\ref{Morten:fig:2p1hvertex}, as well when they considered the
screening of the 2p1h and 2h1p vertices.  Furthermore, as already
mentioned in the introduction, 
Refs.~\citelow{Morten:emm91,Morten:hmm95}
represent already a first serious step towards
the solution of the Parquet equations, i.e., a many-body scheme which
solves self-consistently the equations in the $[12]$, $[13]$ and
$[14]$ channels, with the addition of the self-consistent evaluation
of the self-energy. It ought also to be mentioned that one of the
 first applications for nuclear systems was performed in a
series of papers by Dickhoff and M\"uther and co-workers
\cite{Morten:nuclearmatter}  for nuclear matter. These authors
actually evaluated the first iteration of the three
channels. A similar synthesis of the equations for the 
three channels 
will be made in the next section.

\section{Effective interactions for finite nuclei 
         from Parquet diagrams}
\label{Morten:sec:sec5} 


The equations we discussed in the two previous sections can 
be generalised
in matrix form as
\begin{equation} 
      \Gamma= \Gamma^{[ij]}+\Gamma^{[ij]}\hat{{\cal G}}^{[ij]}\Gamma,
      \label{Morten:eq:generalchannel}
\end{equation}
where obviously $[ij]$ represents a given channel,
$\hat{{\cal G}}^{[ij]}$ is the particle-particle, or hole-hole or particle-hole
propagator. 
The propagator is a product of two single-particle propagators $g$
which we do not specify any further here. They are
defined by the solution of Dyson's equation in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:dyson12}).
The irreducible vertices must appear in the solution of
the self-energy, and conversely, the self-energy must appear in all
single-particle propagators within the expressions for the three
channels $[12]$, $[13]$ and $[14]$. 

For all of our practical purposes, the irreducible vertex used in all
channels is the so-called free $G$ matrix defined in
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:freeg}). We will explain why this is our
preferred choice below.  Let us now define the contribution from the
$[12]$, $[13]$ and $[14]$ channels following
Ref.~\citelow{Morten:jls82}.  Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}) is then
rewritten as
\begin{equation}
    L=\Gamma^{[12]}-G_F,
\end{equation}
where obviously $L$ stands for ladder and if we neglect hole-hole
terms in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}) we obtain 
\begin{equation}
    L=\Delta G =G-G_F,
\end{equation}
that is the ladder corrections beyond first order in our 
irreducible vertex function $G_F$, as discussed in section \ref{Morten:sec:sec3}.
The ladder term can then be rewritten as 
\begin{equation}
    L=G_F\hat{{\cal G}}^{[12]}G_F+G_F\hat{{\cal G}}^{[12]}L.
    \label{Morten:eq:ladder}
\end{equation}
In a similar way we can define the diagrams beyond
first order in the particle-hole channel as
\begin{equation}
    R^{[13]}=\Gamma^{[13]}-G_F,
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
    R^{[14]}=\Gamma^{[14]}-G_F,
\end{equation}
where $G_F$ now is coupled in either the $[13]$ or $[14]$ way.
Rewriting $R^{[ij]}$, where $R$ refers to ring diagrams,
\index{ring diagrams}
we obtain
\begin{equation}
    R^{[ij]}=G_F\hat{{\cal G}}^{[ij]}G_F+G_F\hat{{\cal G}}^{[ij]}R^{[ij]},
    \label{Morten:eq:ring}
\end{equation}
where $ij$ stands for either $[13]$ or $[14]$.  The equation for the
vertex function $\Gamma$ in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:generalchannel})
becomes then
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma=G_F+L+R^{[13]}+R^{[14]}.
     \label{Morten:eq:gammap}
\end{equation}
{\em Note here that the vertex $\Gamma$ can be represented in the coupling
order of any of the above channels}. Our convention is that of the 
$[12]$ channel.


If Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:ladder}) and (\ref{Morten:eq:ring}) define the first iteration,
it should be fairly obvious to see that the next iteration would be
\begin{equation}
    L=\left(G_F+R^{[13]}+R^{[14]}\right)\hat{{\cal G}}^{[12]}\left(G_F+R^{[13]}+R^{[14]}\right)
      +\left(G_F+R^{[13]}+R^{[14]}\right)\hat{{\cal G}}^{[12]}L,
    \label{Morten:eq:laddernext}
\end{equation}
where the contributions $R^{[13]}+R^{[14]} $ are recoupled according to the coupling order
of the $12$-channel. These contributions are irreducible in the $[12]$ channel.
Similarly, for the rings we have
\begin{equation}
    R^{[13]}=\left(G_F+L+R^{[14]}\right)\hat{{\cal G}}^{[13]}
             \left(G_F+L+R^{[14]}\right) + 
             \left(G_F+L+R^{[14]}\right)\hat{{\cal G}}^{[13]}R^{[14]},
    \label{Morten:eq:ring13next}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    R^{[14]}=\left(G_F+L+R^{[13]}\right)\hat{{\cal G}}^{[14]}
             \left(G_F+L+R^{[13]}\right) + 
             \left(G_F+L+R^{[13]}\right)\hat{{\cal G}}^{[14]}R^{[14]}.
    \label{Morten:eq:ring14next}
\end{equation}


Our scheme for calculating $\Gamma$ will be an iterative one based on 
Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:gammap})-(\ref{Morten:eq:ring14next}) 
and the solution of Dyson's equation
for the single-particle propagator. This set of equations will then yield
the two-body Parquet diagrams. 
Relating the above equations to the discussions of sections \ref{Morten:sec:sec3}
and \ref{Morten:sec:sec4}, it is rather easy to see 
that the $G$ matrix, TDA, RPA and Kirson's
screening scheme are contained in 
Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:gammap})-(\ref{Morten:eq:ring14next}).



\subsection{Petit Parquet}

\index{Parquet equations!approximations tp}
The aim here is to present a numerically viable approach
to the Parquet equations.
Here
we will limit ourself to just sketch 
the structure of the solution, more technical details 
will be presented elsewhere \cite{Morten:mhj99}.

The iterative scheme starts with the solution of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:first12}).
The bare vertex which is irreducible in all three channels
is the so-called free $G$ matrix $G_F$ defined in Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:freeg}).
Let us use the identity from Ref.~\citelow{Morten:bbp63} and rewrite the
vertex function $\Gamma^{[12]}$ as
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma^{[12]}=G_F+G_F\left(\frac{Q^{[12]}}{s-H_0}
                               -\frac{1}{s-H_0}\right)\Gamma^{[12]},
\end{equation}
where 
\[
  G_F = V+V\frac{1}{s-H_0}G_F.
\]
We define then $Q^{[12]}=Q_{pp}+Q_{hh}$ and use
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:matrix_relation_q}) to rewrite $Q_{pp}$ and obtain
\begin{equation}
   \Gamma^{[12]}_{(0)}=G_F-G_F\left(\frac{Q_{hh}}{s-H_0}+
   \frac{1}{s-H_0}\tilde{P}\frac{1}{\tilde{P}(s-H_0)^{-1}
   \tilde{P}}\tilde{P}\frac{1}{s-H_0}\right)\Gamma^{[12]}_{(0)}.
   \label{Morten:eq:approx12channel}
\end{equation}
The subscript $(0)$ means that this is just the first iteration.
The single-particle energies are the unperturbed
harmonic oscillator energies.  

Since we will always deal with real single-particle energies,
the two-body propagators of Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator12}),
(\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator13}) and (\ref{Morten:eq:paulioperator14})
will have the same expressions except for the fact that
the single-particle energies get renormalised after each 
iteration. This means that 
the denominators 
in $G_F$, $\Gamma^{[12]}_{(0)}$ and subsequent iterations
and the expressions for the ring diagrams from the $[13]$ and 
$[14]$ channels, 
can be rewritten  via the simple relation
\begin{equation}
     \frac{1}{s\pm \imath\eta}=P\frac{1}{s}\mp\imath\pi\delta(s).
     \label{Morten:eq:principalvalue}
\end{equation}
With this caveat, we can in turn obtain the real and imaginary parts
of all matrices involved.

The first step in our calculations is to evaluate $G_F$.  It is 
calculated in momentum space for a series of starting
energies (typically $\sim 30$).
The principal value integral from Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:principalvalue})
is solved  using Kowalski's
\cite{Morten:kowalski67} 
method. This method  ensures a numerical 
stable treatment with large numbers of
mesh points in momentum space. From the principal value integral we
can in turn define the real and imaginary part of $G_F$, see 
Ref.~\citelow{Morten:rpd89} for technical details.
The matrix $G_F$ is solved only once and transformed
to a harmonic oscillator basis in the lab system from the 
relative and centre of mass system, see Ref.~\citelow{Morten:hko95}
for details.


The second step is to solve Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:approx12channel}),
which is now a complex equation. 
Since the number of two-hole states is rather limited,
typically  $\le 100$
for a given $J$ even for heavy nuclei like Pb, the major
problem in the matrix inversion of Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:approx12channel})
resides in the dimensionality of $\tilde{P}$ discussed in section
\ref{Morten:sec:sec3}. What conditions our truncation of $\tilde{P}$ 
and the number $n_3$, is dictated by the 
\index{Brueckner-Hartree-Fock}
Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) independence on the chosen oscillator parameter
$b$. This choice leads to the inclusion of more than ten major shells
in the computation of the $G$ matrix.
For a given $J$ value, the total number of two-body states
needed can  then be of the order $ \sim 10^4$.

{\em Our first approximation} is therefore to truncate the available
space of single-particle states to be within $\sim 10-20$ major shells.
This choice is based on the BHF criteria and the possibility
to store these large matrices in the RAM of available computing
facilities.  
If we choose to use a double-partitioned model space, we need 
to sum up further diagrams with particle-particle intermediate states.

These two steps lead then to the first iteration of
the ladders, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
     L_{(0)}=\Gamma^{[12]}_{(0)}-G_F.
\end{equation} 
This contains both hole-hole and particle-particle intermediate
states and is a complex matrix. The external single-particle
legs can be particles or holes. Only unperturbed single-particle 
energies enter the definition of the two-body propagators.

The third step is to calculate the first iteration for the  
rings, namely
\begin{equation}
    R_{(0)}^{[13]}=\left(G_F+L_{(0)}\right)\hat{{\cal G}}^{[13]}
             \left(G_F+L_{(0)}\right) + 
             \left(G_F+L_{(0)}\right)\hat{{\cal G}}^{[13]}R_{(0)}^{[13]},
    \label{Morten:eq:ring13first}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    R_{(0)}^{[14]}=\left(G_F+L_{(0)}\right)\hat{{\cal G}}^{[14]}
             \left(G_F+L_{(0)}\right) + 
             \left(G_F+L_{(0)}\right)\hat{{\cal G}}^{[14]}R_{(0)}^{[14]}.
    \label{Morten:eq:ring14first}
\end{equation}
The equations for $L$ and $R$ are all defined within a
truncated Hilbert space. They can therefore be recast into
matrix equations of finite dimensionality.
Recall also  that we need to recouple the contribution
from the $[12]$ channel into the relevant form for the $[13]$ and $[14]$
channels. This is done employing Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:13channel}) and
(\ref{Morten:eq:14channel}). 
With these contributions, we can now obtain the vertex function
$\Gamma$ after the first interaction
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_{(0)}=G_F+L_{(0)}+R_{(0)}^{[13]}+R_{(0)}^{[14]}.
\end{equation}

The fourth step is to compute the self-energy and thereby obtain
new single-particle energies. In so doing, care has to be exercised
in order to avoid double-counting problems. A thorough discussion
of this topic can be found in Ref.~\citelow{Morten:jls82}. More details
will also be presented in Ref.~\citelow{Morten:mhj99}.
Through dispersion relations \cite{Morten:rpd89} we can in turn obtain
the real part of the self-energy and our single-particle energies
will be approximated by
\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon_{\alpha}=t_{\alpha}+\mathrm{Re}\Sigma_{\alpha}.
\end{equation}
This is {\em our second approximation}.
The new single-particle wave functions of 
Eq.~(\ref{Morten:eq:selfconstbasis}) are obtained
by diagonalising a matrix of dimension 
$N\times N$, where $N$ is the number of quantum
numbers $n$ for given $lj$ values. As an example, if $l=0$ and
$j=1/2$ and we impose the limit $2n+l \leq 20$, then $n=0,1\dots 10$
and $N=11$. 

The fifth step is to repeat steps 1-4 with the new single-particle
energies till a predetermined self-consistency is obtained. 
But now the rings have to be included in all equations, i.e.,
we solve Eqs.~(\ref{Morten:eq:gammap})-(\ref{Morten:eq:ring14next}). 

The final vertex $\Gamma$ can then be used to define a 
new effective interaction to be applied in shell model studies,
where many more diagrams are considered than in present 
state of the art calculations, see Fig.~8 of Ref.~\citelow{Morten:jls82}
for a list of diagrams to sixth order entering the definition
of  the irreducible vertex $\Gamma$.

\section{Perspectives}

\label{Morten:sec:sec6}

The reader should always 
keep in mind that the many-body scheme we have focused on 
is only one of several
possible ways of calculating effective interactions. 
For a discussion of several other many-body schemes,
see e.g., other chapters in this volume.

The aim of this work has been to show how one can practically
implement the Parquet equations in order to obtain effective
interactions for the nuclear shell model. The emphasis here has been
to connect these equations with state of the art approaches to
effective interactions. Thus it has been shown how to recover the
standard $G$ matrix equation and the TDA and RPA equations from the
Parquet equations. Applications of this many-body
scheme will be presented elsewhere \cite{Morten:mhj99}, although in
depth discussions and applications of both the $G$ matrix, folded
diagrams and other perturbative resummations can be found in
Refs.~\citelow{Morten:hko95,Morten:eo77}.  There are also subtle
technical details related to double-counting problems in the
iterative Parquet scheme outlined  above that we have left out, due to space
limitations, in the discussion. We take the liberty here to refer to
Refs.~\citelow{Morten:jls82,Morten:scalapino}. They will also be
discussed in Ref.~\citelow{Morten:mhj99}.


In the scheme we have sketched, there are obviously other important
many-body contributions at the two-body level
which cannot be generated by the two-body Parquet equations.
We have also omitted any discussion of three-body terms.
Such terms could be generated if
we were to solve the three-body Parquet equations, see Lande and
Smith \cite{Morten:jls82}.
An implementation of the three-body Parquet equations is in progress.
Three-body terms, as also mentioned in the introduction, are believed
to be important, it should just  suffice
to mention studies of the Triton \cite{Morten:nogga97}. \index{003H@$^3$H}
With only two-body forces  one is also not able
to reproduce properly the nuclear matter saturation point
\cite{Morten:apr98}. 
In connection with three-body contributions one has to carefully
distinguish between three-body forces and effective three-body
interactions. To understand this point consider the following
arguments from studies of infinite nuclear matter and finite nuclei.
The last three years have seen quite some advances in many-body
studies of dense infinite matter, see
Refs.~\citelow{Morten:apr98,Morten:engvik97,Morten:baldo98} for recent
surveys.

\index{nuclear interaction!CD-Bonn}
\index{nuclear interaction!Nijmegen}
\index{nuclear interaction!AV18}
These results can be summarised as follows. 
Firstly, new $NN$  interactions such as
the CD-Bonn potential \cite{Morten:cdbonn}, different Nijmegen interactions
\cite{Morten:nijmegen94} and the recent Argonne AV18 interaction
\cite{Morten:argv18}
all fit 
the set of scattering data of the 
Nijmegen group 
with a $\chi^2$ per datum close to 1. All these interactions,
when applied to calculations of the equation of state (EoS),
yield essentially similar equations of state up to
densities of $3-4$ nuclear matter saturation density  
for both pure neutron matter
and $\beta$-stable matter when 
the non-relativistic lowest-order Brueckner theory (LOB) is used. 
Other properties like the 
symmetry energy and proton fractions do also show
a similar quantitative agreement, see Ref.~\citelow{Morten:engvik97} for more
details.
Secondly, the inclusion of more complicated 
many-body terms at the two-body \cite{Morten:apr98}
level does not alter this picture and even the recent 
summation of three-hole line diagrams of Baldo and co-workers
\cite{Morten:baldo98} results in an EoS which is  
close to LOB when a continuous
choice is used for the single-particle energies in matter
\cite{Morten:baldo98}. The latter are examples of effective
three-body contributions. These findings 
are also in line with
recent works on the energy of pure neutron 
drops, where three-body clusters are included \cite{Morten:ndrops97},
and large-scale shell-model calculations of Sn 
isotopes including 
effective three-body interactions \cite{Morten:eho99}.
Differences do however occur 
when one introduces real three-body forces.
These are necessary
in order to reproduce the saturation properties of nuclear matter
\cite{Morten:apr98} and the binding energy of light nuclei \cite{Morten:vijay}.


The reader may then eventually ask why do we bother at all to solve
the two-body set of Parquet equations when most likely these new
effective interactions will not cure any of the problems
seen in shell model studies or nuclear matter. One needs at least to
include some realistic three-body force and thereby to solve
the three-body Parquet equations. 
The problem however with real three-body forces is that presently
we have no serious candidates which exhibit the same level
of quality and sophistication 
as the $NN$  interactions mentioned above.
The introduction of such forces lead therefore to strong model
dependencies. Moreover, to assess properly many-body terms at the two-body
level is an important, and not yet solved, problem \emph{per se}.
The Parquet equations allow one also to include in a self-consistent way
several many-body terms, fulfil crossing symmetries and
satisfy certain sum rules. In addition, the Green's function formalism
can be tailored for finite temperatures. 
This is clearly of interest for studies of infinite matter at finite
temperature, such as dense matter occurring in a newly born
neutron star. 
The application of the Parquet equation in nuclear and neutron matter will also
allow for a consistent treatment of screening effects relevant for
the pairing problem. Such work is in progress.

I have greatly benefitted from many discussions on Parquet theory with
Andy Jackson. Moreover, many interactions with David Dean, Paul Ellis,
Torgeir Engeland, Tom Kuo, Herbert M\"uther, Artur Polls, Eivind Osnes
and Andres Zuker have hopefully matured some of the ideas exposed,
although any eventual flaws are obviously to be retraced to the
